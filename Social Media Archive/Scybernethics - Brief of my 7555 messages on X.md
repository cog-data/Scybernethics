**Introduction:**

This document analyzes a series of messages from "X_soto_messages.txt," revealing a complex and interconnected set of ideas revolving around cognition, technology, ethics, and the nature of being. The messages reveal the development of a personal philosophical framework referred to as "scybernethics" and frequently use concepts from cybernetics, phenomenology, and Buddhist philosophy. The author, "Soto¬≤," appears to be deeply concerned with the impact of technology on the human mind, particularly how it may be mechanizing our thinking and limiting our potential. There's also a strong emphasis on embodied cognition, the importance of individual experience, and a rejection of purely reductionist approaches.

**I. Core Concepts and Themes:**

- **Scybernethics:**
  
  - **Definition:** The most prominent theme is the development and explanation of "scybernethics." It's defined as a "pragmatic self-somaesthetics coupled with Episteme and Techne" and a "phenomenology and an esthethics of thinking as an internal and enacted embodied gesture." It's presented as an alternative framework to existing approaches in cybernetics and cognitive science.
  
  - **Second-Order Rationality:** Scybernethics is also described as a "second-order (idiosyncratic) 1P/3P rationality (rationality¬≤)." This suggests a reflexive approach, integrating both first-person (subjective) experience and third-person (objective) perspectives.
  
  - **Embodied Sense-Making:** A central tenet of scybernethics is the importance of embodied sense-making. This refers to the idea that our understanding of the world is deeply intertwined with our physical bodies and experiences. Soto¬≤ states, "It is the maintaining of the (erotic) tension between both which generate my own body sense-making."
  
  - **Praxis:** Scybernethics is not purely theoretical; it is intended to be lived and enacted. This emphasis on praxis is captured in the phrase, "[Message from/to myself: shut up and praxis! üòÅ]."
  
  - **Methodological Toolbox:** Scybernethics is described as a "_methodological toolbox_ for embodying enaction toward (inspirational & ethical) second-order generative enaction: the enaction of the enactor." This highlights its active, self-reflexive, and generative nature.
 
  - **Dia-grams:** Soto¬≤ uses the term "dia-gram" to refer to a quasi-matrix or tool for self-interpretation. Dia-grams emphasize the process of discretization of continuous information to make it reproducible and calculable, but also as a tool for understanding the phenomenological. This contrasts with the reductionist approaches of some sciences.


- **Critique of Reductionism and Mechanization of Mind:**
  
  - **Operationality:** Soto¬≤ critiques the "operational" and "reductionist mentality" that is seen as destroying "ourselves and the planet," with particular concern about the reduction of consciousness to physical processes.

  - **Mecanizing the Mind:** There's a recurring concern about the mechanization of the mind. The messages ask, "to what extend _our own minds_, historically and socially, are on the long term _mecanized_ by this deep epistemological trend?!" The use of technology, especially large language models (LLMs) and "Big Data," is seen as a potential source of this mechanization. He also criticizes the "massive instrumentalization of people's inner cognitive behaviors by private interests" related to ML and DS.

  - **Turing-Von Neumann Gesture:** Soto¬≤ sees the Turing-Von Neumann approach as a "double cut": "the cut to meaning, which is reduced, and the cut to matter, which is abstract." This reduction of meaning and abstraction of matter is viewed as problematic.

  
- **Emphasis on Phenomenology and Embodiment:**
  
  - **First-Person Experience:** There is a consistent emphasis on the importance of first-person experience and phenomenological inquiry. Soto¬≤ describes the microscope as a "phenomenology and disciplined first person approach."

  - **Lived Body (Leib) vs. Physical Body (K√∂rper):** Soto¬≤ distinguishes between the lived body (Leib) and the physical body (K√∂rper). This highlights the importance of subjective experience in understanding the body. The body and language are presented as two synthetic polarities.
  
  
- **Self-Design and Embodiment:** Soto¬≤ frequently cites Richard Shusterman's somaesthetics as a core influence and highlights the importance of embodied experience for self-understanding and design.

 
- **Mind as a Gesture:** Soto¬≤ has gradually converged toward an "aesthetical conception of the/my mind based on my phenomenological experience." He also proposes the concept of the "Mind as a gesture," which is also directly tied with the idea of "Form as a Dia-gram."


- **The Role of Language and Representation:**
  
  - **Linguistic Bodies:** Soto¬≤ explores the idea that we are "Linguistic bodies," highlighting the role of language in shaping our understanding of the world. He points to the influence of language and how it can be used to "play us."
  
  - **Mechanization of Language:** There's concern about how mechanizing the world also mechanizes the language and, as a result, the mind. He asks, "How will this impact their/our representation or the collective wisdom encapsulated in our language?!"

  
- **Critique of Traditional Science and Epistemology:**

  - **Attentional Grids:** Soto¬≤ views theories and paradigms as "attentional grids." This suggests that they are not objective representations of reality but are instead interpretative frameworks.
  
  - **No Self-Founded Formal System:** He expresses skepticism about formal systems and declares that "no formal system can be self-founded," which references G√∂del's incompleteness theorems.
  
  - **Epistemological Flexibility:** He emphasizes the importance of epistemological flexibility, acknowledging that "the territory is only contraints, the observer-actor make meaning of the map." Theories are viewed as "attentional grids for the observer-actor."
 
  
- **Real Epistemology (3P-1P):** Soto¬≤ calls for a "Real Epistemology" that includes both 3rd-person and 1st-person perspectives, highlighting his dissatisfaction with purely objective and reductionist approaches in science.

  
- **Exploration of Paradox and Ambiguity:**

  - **Groundless Ground:** Soto¬≤ often grapples with the idea of a "groundless ground" of sense-making, a concept that seems to be linked to Buddhist philosophy. He sees this as an important point in the study of sense-making.
  
  - **Double Binds:** He mentions facing painful and emancipatory "double binds" in the process of self-understanding.
  
  - **Creative Paradox:** He also sees the potential for creative paradox, describing the process of thinking as "a co-creative paradox."
 
    
- **Ethical Concerns:**

  - **DARPA and Military Tech:** Soto¬≤ expresses ethical concern about the involvement of DARPA in the development of military technologies, particularly in conjunction with the development of robots.
  
  - **Instrumentalization of Cognition:** He worries about the "massive instrumentalization of people's inner cognitive behaviors by private interests," referencing the ethical implications of ML and data science.
 
  
- **Other Influences & Concepts:**

  - **Bernard Stiegler:** Stiegler is a significant influence for Soto¬≤, and he credits him for the concept of _pharmakon_ as an "historically rooted empowering word." Stiegler's concept of the "idiotext" is also cited.
  
  - **Gilbert Simondon:** Simondon's concept of individuation is central, and Soto¬≤ contrasts it with "individualization." He notes, "Individuation is therefore not an ‚Äúindividualist‚Äù process in the sense that there would be separation or emancipation of the individual from the environment. On the contrary, the environment (natural, social) is as if integrated into the individual." He also often refers to Simondon's idea of "transduction".

  - **Buddhist Philosophy:** There's a clear convergence towards Buddhist epistemology, citing the Buddhist model of sense perception and describing the concept of "emptiness" as a "tool to liberate yourself."

  - **Varela and Maturana:** Varela and Maturana's work on autopoiesis and enaction is also significant to the formation of Soto¬≤'s thought. The concept of "enaction" in the original Varelian sense is central, as is the idea of biological autonomy.

  - **Zen:** Soto¬≤ incorporates several Zen ideas, such as the relationship between mountains and clouds, and the Zen practice of letting the cow graze.
 
  
- **Use of Technology as a Tool:**

  - **LLMs:** Soto¬≤ explores the use of LLMs as surrealist tools for exploring concepts and also emphasizes their limitations in areas like "semantics."
  
  - **RAG:** Soto¬≤ uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques with LLMs to create a knowledge base for "Scybernethics," indicating that technology can still be used in service of reflective self-exploration.



**II. Specific Ideas and Quotes:**

- **"If", but in my scybernethics perspective, analogical "reasoning" (I should better say "rationalizing") is not (only) horizontal, and I see more abstraction as a special case of analogy, meaning not only it's dualist / dyadic complementary.**" - This shows Soto¬≤'s nuanced understanding of analogy and abstraction and how it might not be exclusively a dyadic process.

- **"Scybernethics could be understood as a pragmatic self-somaesthetics coupled with Episteme and Techne. It is a phenomenology and an esthethics of thinking as an internal and enacted embodied gesture."** - A clear, concise definition of Scybernethics.

- **"I've to always thinks at two levels: my first person perspective as observator-actor and the third person objective/intersubjective pov. It is the maintening of the (erotic) tension between both which generate my own body sense-making. Thinking¬≤ is sexy! üòé"** - Explains the key 1st-person/3rd-person duality at the core of Scybernethics and the importance of experience in sense-making.

- **"The Turing-Von Neumann gesture was in fact a ‚Äúùó±ùóºùòÇùóØùóπùó≤ ùó∞ùòÇùòÅ‚Äù, ‚Äú... of the digital (Bachimont 2017, 2018): the cut to meaning, which is reduced, and the cut to matter, which is abstract.‚Äù(Bachimont 2021: 6)"** - A critical take on the core computational approach to AI, emphasizing what it misses.

- **"The 'vesania of solipsism's' specter is a scarecrow for armchair philosophers: this consciousness self-validation's "gesture" is for me inevitably enacted by bodily gestural and tactile ambiguity at the same time as sensation & proprioception . The world makes me while I make it."** - Soto¬≤'s unique take on the problem of solipsism and how the body and the world are mutually constitutive.

- **"The ancient Greek mathematician and engineer Hero of Alexandria defined a gnomon as that which, when added or subtracted to an entity (number or shape), makes a new entity similar to the starting entity."** - Illustrates the concept of self-similarity and recursion which are important themes.

- **"What makes us DIFFERENT from the plants, the animals, the other creatures that just have mind?! ... your purpose is to become _as fully human as possible_."** - A clear explanation of Soto¬≤'s goal, which contrasts with mere "operationality."

- **"Shaping enactively my mind, shaping esthetically my world (with culture, technologies and nature)" Soto¬≤."** This statement reveals a core theme of active engagement and self-transformation through action.

- **"Biological matter" is a conception enacted by _minds_. It doesn't deny at all the value of the scientific inquiry and worldview, it just relativize it in a socio-historical epistemologic context, giving space for a more complex meta-dualist extension of our Western rationality.** This highlights how different epistemological viewpoints can complement rather than negate each other.



**III. Conclusion:**

The messages in "X_soto_messages.txt" reveal a highly complex and nuanced perspective on the relationship between technology, mind, and ethics. Soto¬≤ is developing a personal framework, "scybernethics," that seeks to integrate phenomenological insight, cybernetic principles, and Buddhist philosophy, while challenging purely reductionist scientific approaches. This framework prioritizes embodiment, lived experience, and a recognition of the limits of purely objective methods. There's a constant push to acknowledge the interplay between subject and object, and a concern about how digital technologies may be shaping our minds, often without our conscious awareness. The documents illustrate a reflexive exploration of the nature of cognition and the role of agency in our collective and individual experience. The final, more personal messages suggest a long intellectual journey and a commitment to a unique perspective, regardless of external recognition.

The consistent references to enaction, a kind of doing and being, as a way to access a deeper understanding of the nature of mind, the world, and their complex relationship, is also notable. The numerous self-citations, the use of "Soto¬≤" as a personal brand and concept, and the open invitation to ask questions, suggest that the author is actively cultivating and promoting their unique approach to understanding.
