Message: @tasshinfogleman I like your analogy because it generates a cognitive dissonance in me that makes me think, and I thank you for that. I understand the relational dimension, but I also see a dimension of external cohercivity in (social) work and its remuneration coming from society 1/2

Message: @StevenShorrock @rob_england @laraghavan To be more precise, the context of Stengers is post-capitalism thinking. But fair-enough.

I think that the ambiguity don't come so much from the verb "processed" (dynamic) but more from the very notion of "information" (vs in-formation). "outside" info.

Date: 2023-08-13 18:33:55
Message: @arisbe__ @JonAlanSchmidt I have watched a good half of his latest video, and I was impressed by his work but not at all by it's framework: if I remember correctly, it seems that it relies on a naive physicalist conception of science and that he has a big blindspot between perception and mind, that is 1/2

Message: @arisbe__ @JonAlanSchmidt May be because he is a prolific and original creator, so it is hard to "be in his shoes", and he seems to be breaking with the historical tradition(?) with a totalizing theoretical framework, like a religion. But I take it for now as an heuristic and hermeneutic tool.

Date: 2023-08-13 19:19:40
Message: @JonAlanSchmidt @arisbe__ Idiosyncratic: creative and personal - sign: formalization of a relation, and representation is a synonymous of formalization. - 1st person: phenomenological (Husserl, view from within) to be put in regard with third person (scientific, view from outside) perspective.

Date: 2023-08-13 19:37:40
Message: @arisbe__ @JonAlanSchmidt I understand better. Is it linked to the experimental/empirical domain? Because if not, it's a very interesting but totalizing and abstract interpretative grid of everything. So trying now to make it "realist" seems to me very strange and, to say the least, suspicious.

Date: 2023-08-13 19:49:22
Message: @arisbe__ @JonAlanSchmidt Neither do I. Good point: may be his work could be related meaningfully with the key phenomenological notion of "intentionality", also coming from the scholastic tradition. I will try to think about it.

Date: 2023-08-14 03:50:48
Message: @JonAlanSchmidt @FHaruspex @arisbe__ a milestone for me. I ended up with an expressive/intersubjectivable formalization of the "processual" type, but the elementary cognitive act remains for me the distinction (and not the relation). Abduction is for me the description of underlying biological distributed processes.

Date: 2023-08-14 04:09:42
Message: @JonAlanSchmidt @FHaruspex @arisbe__ I say "not the relation" to make an expressive/cultural distinction, but I should better say "more than the relation". It's like a (scientific) methodological &amp; ethical imperative: before synthetizing, one should make an analytical distinction. But of course relation come "next".

Date: 2023-08-14 04:31:04
Message: @arisbe__ @FHaruspex @JonAlanSchmidt It may seems very strange, and I think it is the blind spot here, but it is the knowing and doing of *Technics*, &amp; today of the "parallel &amp; distributed processing" techs (aka "AI/Deep learning/ChatGpt") that solve all this. It's not a hazard if this is *psycho-technologies*.  1/2

Date: 2023-08-14 04:37:19
Message: @arisbe__ @FHaruspex @JonAlanSchmidt I can't explain it here, it's complex, but in a nutshell: in my work I used computer simulation of artificial cognition (&amp; also cognitive epistemology) to reflect "objectively" on my own mind dynamics, including the creative aspect of modeling toward inner self-understanding. 2/2

Date: 2024-03-14 07:41:33

Message: In fact, enaction is not "anti" anything, it's more subtle: it is "met(t)a". 

The "anti-representationalist" posture was elaborated to clearly distinguish itself in the beginning from cognitivism, the dominant paradigm of sciences and technologies of cognition, STC)

Message: in the scientific linguistic domain ruled by the intersubjective dualist propositional logic. This is not that, the third is excluded.

Date: 2024-03-14 07:43:18
Message: Moreover, enaction is not "anti-representationalist" because it explain how representations themselves are "enacted". A first level of understanding is to think it as the embodied emergence of representations (like the one I'm currently elaborating right now).

Date: 2024-03-14 07:44:09
Message: This imply a hermeneutic/co-determining circulation between two polarities: the 1P, 1st person/phenomenologic point of view or "view from inside" perspective, which is *embodied*, and the 3d person one (classic science/Cartesianist/Cognitivist)

Date: 2024-03-14 07:44:51
Message: So on this first level of understanding, enaction is a rational way to approach the embodied emergence of abstraction, both at the individual but also at the collective level: this is the "Participatory Sense-Making" approach.

Message: "ANN" or worse "Deep Learning" are misleading and fallacious designations. Heuristics confused with rigorous scientific terminology.

Date: 2024-03-14 07:47:21
Message: Enaction is one step ahead these types of modeling. It doesn't deny them, but include and integrate them in a second-order perspective which include the observer-actor and think the self and the world not as pre-given but as brought-forth, as "enacted".

Date: 2024-03-14 07:48:27
Message: So to think "enactively", one need to cultivate an *epistemological flexibility* to be able to circulate between these types of complementary perspectives and to relate them to his own relative and temporary understanding.

Date: 2024-03-14 07:48:36
Message: This is why enaction is not an easy rhetorical (like cognitivism) or objectively effective (like technologies) way. But converging *iteratively and patiently* toward deep truth and reality has never been easy, or science itself wouldn't exist at the first place.

Message: [ Scybernethics Methodology: Working with Conceptual Dipoles ] üßµü™°

In Scybernethics, a significant part of the philosophical and conceptual work of elaboration (cf. Deleuze) has been done with what I have called "conceptual dipoles" https://t.co/dhC62U9v43

Date: 2024-07-06 06:52:30
Message: (dualities, dichotomies, dialectical opposites) such as parts/whole, inside/outside, explanation/understanding, localized/distributed, intentionality/agency, episteme/techne, form/process... leading to my finally enacted prototypical concept of "quasi-bidimensionality".

Date: 2024-07-06 06:57:42
Message: Interestingly, this conceptual enaction has relied on the reasoned co-evolution of *both method and representation*, as in any scientific discipline/ontologic domain (i.e. phenomenological/cognitive domain).

Date: 2024-07-06 06:58:18
Message: The first phase of this work is classical: an enrichment of conceptual polarities through the study of classics and academic references. This implicitly allows us to develop a sense of the quality of sources and reasoning styles.

Date: 2024-07-06 06:59:49
Message: It is particularly key here to maintain a neutral *suspension of judgment* during this phase in order to absorb the different points of view. Implicitly we also observe the revelation of our own prejudices and metaphysical implicits, which must be neutralized (awareness &amp; ethic).

Date: 2024-07-06 07:01:04
Message: This "top-down" work is carried out until a form of saturation is reached, thereby gradually allowing the *cultural/political and historical contexts* of the two conceptual orientations to emerge.

Date: 2024-07-06 07:02:05
Message: I worked with a tool for memorizing these dipoles (or simple concepts), a semantic network/mind map, which allowed me to accumulate these dichotomies in large numbers (several hundred) while leaving them suspended (cf. my "brain").

Date: 2024-07-06 07:03:03
Message: Later I also understood this tool as a *hypomnemata* (Foucault, Stiegler): a self-writing tool.

Date: 2024-07-06 07:05:25
Message: A first phenomenological observation is the observation of the *asymmetry of grasping* polarities: one of the concepts can generally be more easily "seized" by a precise definition, a quantification than the other. It is generally the one favored by the "hard"/natural sciences.

Date: 2024-07-06 07:07:08
Message: The other polarity, more difficult to grasp analytically because more qualitative, is generally expelled from the side of the human and social sciences. It is another form of reductionism, in addition to materialist/physicalist reductionism, to which reference is rarely made.

Date: 2024-07-06 07:08:10
Message: Here my *exploratory ethics* was contrary: to go to the side of the "weak parent" of the alternative to deepen it.

Date: 2024-07-06 07:09:02
Message: All of these methodological steps also gradually gave rise to a bodily awareness linked to the evaluation of these polarities that I called "weighing". For me, this is the *phenomenological origin of the notion of calculation*:

Date: 2024-07-06 07:09:46
Message: the two elements are evaluated by an internalized gesture of weighing, as if the semantic values ‚Äã‚Äãof each pole were assimilated to a mass that one would hold in each internal "hand", allowing one to indicate a difference, a preference. This is real *com-putation*.

Date: 2024-07-06 07:10:32
Message: The effect of saturation and suspension combined will also give birth, with patience, to creative intuitive enactions, new ideas, based on the gaps and differences in this linguistic conceptual space. This is the "Bottom-Up" effect, complementary to the first.

Date: 2024-07-06 07:11:23
Message: These new ideas will be at the origin of new exploratory research. It is notable here that most of the time, especially at the beginning, one often realizes that the "brilliant ideas" that one can have have long been studied in detail and with rigor by the academy.

Date: 2024-07-10 05:55:35
Message: But there is another form of illusion, more subtle and cognitive, from which classical Cartesian and cognitivist science is not exempt, due to its symbolic elimination of the observer-actor (the connoisseur) and its normative "view from nowhere":

Date: 2024-07-10 05:55:49
Message: that of being mistaken about the nature of the object of cognitive engagement. The classic example here is the optical illusion or the traditional one of the rope on the ground taken in the darkness of the evening for a snake.

Date: 2024-07-19 11:42:38
Message: 1. the "Ambijective Gesture": 

The scybernethics framework already emphasizes a constant cycling between objective, third-person perspectives and subjective, first-person experiences, termed the "ambijective gesture".

Date: 2024-07-19 11:42:47
Message: This gesture itself can be understood as a core manifestation of agency. It highlights the active role of the individual in navigating and integrating different perspectives, shaping their own understanding and relation to knowledge.

Message: 2. "Dialogical Dialectics" as Enactment of Agency:

The concept of "dialogical dialectics," which involves holding the tension between opposing poles of a concept in suspension, directly reflects the sense of agency.

Date: 2024-07-19 11:43:50
Message: This active engagement with contrasting viewpoints, rather than seeking a simplistic synthesis, embodies the individual's agency in constructing meaning.

Date: 2024-07-19 11:44:49
Message: 3. "Processual Thinking" as Embodied Agency:

Central to scybernethics is the notion of "processual thinking" - understanding concepts as dynamic processes rather than static entities. This mode of thought inherently implies agency.

Date: 2024-07-19 11:45:03
Message: Engaging in "processual thinking" requires actively tracing the emergence of concepts, understanding them as products of interactions and transformations, reflecting the agency inherent in shaping knowledge.

Message: 4. "Techno-Experiential Schemes" and Technological Agency:

Scybernethics utilizes computer simulations to understand cognitive processes, leading to the formation of "techno-experiential schemes".

Scybernethics identifies a close connection between the framework's core concepts and the philosophical notion of "intentionality".

In scybernethics, top-down and bottom-up modeling are always coupled through a co-determining hermeneutic and heuristic circulation. 

The conception of theories and models as "attentional grids" is key.

Date: 2024-07-20 08:22:30
Message: Here's an explanation of how these concepts are interpretated by using this approach:

1. Theories and models as attentional grids:

 In scybernethics, theories and models are viewed as ways of  seeing and thinking - essentially "attentional grids"

Date: 2024-07-20 08:22:42
Message: that shape our  perception and understanding of phenomena. This concept emphasizes that  our theoretical frameworks actively influence what we observe and how we  interpret it.

Date: 2024-07-20 08:23:19
Message: 2. Emergence through the attentional grid:
 
Emergence, in this context, can be seen as the recognition  of new patterns or properties that become visible when we apply a  particular attentional grid.

Date: 2024-07-20 08:23:35
Message: It's not just about phenomena arising from lower-level interactions, but also about our cognitive ability to  perceive and conceptualize these new patterns.

Date: 2024-07-20 08:24:11
Message: 3. Downward causation as a shift in perspective:

From the scybernethics viewpoint, downward causation might  be understood as the way our higher-level conceptual frameworks  (attentional grids) influence our understanding and interpretation of  lower-level phenomena.

Date: 2024-07-20 08:24:33
Message: It's a form of cognitive feedback where our  models shape what we perceive at more fundamental levels.

Date: 2024-07-20 08:25:26
Message: 4. Circular causality:

The scybernethics approach emphasizes the circular nature  of causality in complex systems. The attentional grid concept highlights how our understanding of emergence and downward causation

Message: are part of a reflexive process where our models both shape and are shaped by our  observations.

Date: 2024-07-20 08:26:24
Message: 5. Self-reference and observer inclusion:

By framing theories as attentional grids, scybernethics  explicitly includes the observer in the system being observed. This  aligns with the second-order cybernetics principle of including the  observer in the observation.

Date: 2024-07-20 08:26:56
Message: 6. Dynamic interplay:

The relationship between emergence and downward causation  in this framework is seen as a dynamic interplay between different  levels of abstraction in our attentional grids.

Date: 2024-07-20 08:27:16
Message: Lower-level interactions give rise to emergent properties, which in turn influence how we  conceptualize and attend to those lower-level phenomena.

Date: 2024-07-20 08:27:48
Message: 7. Cognitive enaction:

This perspective aligns with the enactive approach in  cognitive science, suggesting that our understanding of emergence and  downward causation is not just about objective phenomena,

Date: 2024-07-20 08:28:04
Message: but also about  how we actively construct and enact our cognitive world through our theoretical frameworks.

Date: 2024-07-20 08:28:52
Message: 8. Flexibility and adaptability:

Viewing theories as attentional grids allows for greater  flexibility in understanding complex phenomena.

Date: 2024-07-20 08:29:00
Message: It encourages shifting  between different perspectives or "grids" to gain a more comprehensive understanding of emergent properties and causal relationships.

Date: 2024-07-20 08:29:34
Message: 9. Ethical and pragmatic implications:

This approach has ethical implications, as it emphasizes  our responsibility in choosing and developing the attentional grids we  use.

Date: 2024-07-20 08:29:46
Message: It also has pragmatic value, encouraging us to be more aware of how  our theoretical frameworks shape our understanding and to actively  explore alternative perspectives.

Date: 2024-07-20 08:30:25
Message: 9. Integration of levels:

Finally, this scybernethics perspective promotes an  integration of different levels of description, recognizing that  emergence and downward causation are part of a unified cognitive process of making sense of complex systems.

Date: 2024-07-20 08:31:04
Message: In summary, the scybernethics perspective on downward causation and emergence, viewed through the concept of theories and models as attentional grids, offers a nuanced, self-reflexive approach to  understanding these phenomena.

Message: I will illustrate it here with the example of natural evolution. A classical algorithmic translation of Darwinism (a simplification of Darwin ideas) is what is called metaphorically and heuristically a "genetic algorithm". Its iterative principles are quite simple:

Message: 1. A diversity generator: usually a fake "genetic coding of functional traits" represented by a linear stable memory container which is then coupled with some more or less random "mutations" and with "sexual crossover" between simulated "agents" at each generation.

Date: 2024-08-23 08:03:25

Date: 2024-08-23 08:04:04
Message: So the virtual logic of such design is the following: at each "generation", a pool of agents is generated, based on their "genetic code", leading to a functional variety in regard to the potential solutions of "the problem" that they represent functionally.

Date: 2024-08-23 08:04:40
Message: Each agent is then tested against its performances and ranked in accordance. The "best" agents/solutions are selected, the worse eliminated and replace by a random breeding of the best performers.

Message: This algorithmic process is *limited to a specific space problem* and rely in its principle on the key *top-down* representationalist definition of the "fitness function" related to a specific "functional trait" that one want to optimize. It is a control algorithm.

Both shares the same influences (enaction) and objectives: to exceed the mind-mind problem (extension of the traditional mind-body problem, Jackendoff), i.e. relating computational &amp; phenomenological aspects of the mind. https://t.co/Jjh5cEcA02 https://t.co/2yahPNnPcZ

Date: 2025-01-05 13:50:15
Message: While neurophenomenology is polarized on the traditional first order of science, coupling the rational dimension with experimental empiricism, scybernethics is more philosophically polarized and aimed at the active transformation of the observer-actor himself.

Date: 2025-01-05 13:51:28
Message: In short, neurophenomenology is more normative while scybernethics is more heuristic and hermeneutical. Two faces of enactive science.
