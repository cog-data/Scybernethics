""Uncovering the Intersection of Reason and Rationality: an Epistemological Analysis.""
<h5 id=""wpaicg-introduction"">Introduction</h5>
This paper will provide an epistemological analysis of the differences and common points of reason and rationality. This analysis will be both theoretical and historical, examining the production of scientific knowledge and how it has been shaped by reason and rationality. We will explore the implications of these two concepts, and how they have been used to shape the development of scientific culture. Additionally, the paper will also discuss the implications of this analysis for the future of scientific knowledge production.
<h3 id=""wpaicg-exploring-the-relationship-between-reason-and-rationality-in-epistemology"">Exploring the Relationship Between Reason and Rationality in Epistemology</h3>
Epistemology is the study of knowledge and how it is acquired. It is a branch of philosophy that examines the nature of knowledge and how it is acquired. Reason and rationality are two concepts that are closely related in epistemology. Reason is the capacity for logical thought, while rationality is the quality of being reasonable. Both concepts are essential for acquiring knowledge.

Reason can be defined as the capacity of human beings to think logically and rationally. It is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, and it plays a central role in scientific inquiry. Scientists use reason to construct hypotheses, design experiments, and analyze data. Reason is also an important tool for evaluating scientific claims and arguments.

Rationality, on the other hand, is a broader concept that encompasses not only logical reasoning but also other cognitive processes, such as intuition, perception, and emotion. Rationality involves the use of reason in the context of practical decision-making, and it is closely related to the concept of critical thinking.

While reason and rationality are both important for scientific inquiry, they differ in their scope and purpose. Reason is primarily concerned with the logical coherence of arguments and the validity of conclusions, whereas rationality is concerned with the practical consequences of decisions and actions.
<h3 id=""wpaicg-examining-the-role-of-scientific-knowledge-production-in-epistemology"">Examining the Role of Scientific Knowledge Production in Epistemology</h3>
The production of scientific knowledge has long been a cornerstone of epistemology, the branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of knowledge and how it is acquired. Scientific knowledge production is a complex process that involves the collection and analysis of data, the formulation of hypotheses, and the testing of those hypotheses through experimentation. This process is essential to the advancement of scientific understanding and the development of new theories and technologies.

At its core, scientific knowledge production is a process of inquiry. Scientists ask questions about the natural world and seek to answer them through observation, experimentation, and analysis. This process is guided by the scientific method, which involves the formulation of a hypothesis, the collection of data, and the testing of the hypothesis through experimentation. Through this process, scientists are able to gain a better understanding of the natural world and develop new theories and technologies.

The production of scientific knowledge is also an important part of epistemology. By examining the process of scientific inquiry, philosophers are able to gain insight into the nature of knowledge and how it is acquired. This process helps to identify the sources of knowledge and the methods by which it is acquired. It also helps to identify the limitations of scientific knowledge and the ways in which it can be improved.
<h3 id=""wpaicg-analyzing-the-impact-of-historical-context-on-reason-and-rationality"">Analyzing the Impact of Historical Context on Reason and Rationality</h3>
Throughout history, reason and rationality have been shaped by the context in which they are applied. From the ancient Greeks to the Enlightenment, the way in which reason and rationality are understood and used has been heavily influenced by the prevailing cultural, political, and religious beliefs of the time.

The ancient Greeks, for example, believed that reason and rationality were the highest forms of knowledge and that they could be used to understand the world around them. This led to the development of the scientific method, which relied on observation and experimentation to uncover the truth. The Greeks also believed that reason and rationality could be used to make moral decisions, and this led to the development of ethical theories such as utilitarianism.

The Enlightenment period saw a shift in the way reason and rationality were viewed. This period was marked by a focus on individualism and the belief that reason and rationality could be used to create a better society. This led to the development of the concept of human rights and the idea that individuals should be free to pursue their own interests.

The Industrial Revolution also had an impact on reason and rationality. This period saw the rise of the scientific method and the development of new technologies that allowed for the mass production of goods. This led to a greater emphasis on efficiency and the belief that reason and rationality could be used to create a more efficient society.

Finally, the modern era has seen a shift in the way reason and rationality are viewed. This period has seen a greater emphasis on the importance of emotion and intuition in decision-making. This has led to the development of new theories such as behavioral economics, which focus on the role of emotions in decision-making.

Overall, it is clear that the historical context in which reason and rationality are applied has had a significant impact on the way they are understood and used. From the ancient Greeks to the modern era, the way in which reason and rationality are viewed has been heavily influenced by the prevailing cultural, political, and religious beliefs of the time. As such, it is important to consider the historical context when examining the impact of reason and rationality on society.

Reason and rationality are two of the most fundamental philosophical concepts, and have been the subject of debate and discussion for centuries. They are closely intertwined, yet distinct in their own right. Reason is the capacity for logical thought, while rationality is the application of reason to make decisions.

Reason is the ability to think logically and draw conclusions from evidence. It is the capacity to understand the world around us and to make sense of it. Reason is the basis for all knowledge and understanding, and is essential for making decisions. It is the foundation of science, philosophy, and all other forms of knowledge.

Rationality is the application of reason to make decisions. It is the ability to think logically and objectively, and to make decisions based on evidence and logical reasoning. Rationality is the basis for all ethical and moral decisions, and is essential for making decisions that are in the best interests of oneself and others.

<h3 id=""wpaicg-comparing-and-contrasting-reason-and-rationality-in-epistemology"">Comparing and Contrasting Reason and Rationality in Epistemology</h3>
Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of knowledge and how it is acquired. Reason and rationality are two important concepts in epistemology, and while they are related, they are distinct. Reason is the capacity of the mind to think, understand, and form judgments based on evidence and logic. Rationality is the quality of being reasonable and consistent in thought and action.

Reason is the basis for forming judgments and making decisions. It is the ability to think logically and draw conclusions based on evidence. Reason is the foundation of knowledge, as it allows us to make sense of the world around us and form valid conclusions. Reason is also the basis for moral decision-making, as it allows us to evaluate the consequences of our actions and make decisions that are in line with our values.

Rationality, on the other hand, is the quality of being reasonable and consistent in thought and action. It is the ability to think logically and make decisions based on evidence and logic. Rationality is the basis for making decisions that are in line with our values and beliefs. It is the ability to think critically and objectively, and to make decisions that are in our best interests.

In conclusion, reason and rationality are two important concepts in epistemology. Reason is the capacity of the mind to think, understand, and form judgments based on evidence and logic. Rationality is the quality of being reasonable, logical, and consistent in thought and action. Both are essential for forming valid conclusions and making decisions that are in line with our values and beliefs.",,2023-02-24,post,https://scybernethics.org/?p=47729,,,,,,,,"Non classé",,,draft,3,Christophe_Rigon,christophe.rigon@scybernethics.org,Christophe,Rigon,__trashed,,,0,0,0,closed,open,2023-02-24

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"">The deep civilizational roots of functionalism and mechanical thinking</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Me</strong>: ""Explain the epistemological relation between cognitive functionalism and mechanical thinking, both in a theoretical and historical sense.""<br><br><strong>ChatGPT4</strong>:<br>""Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that deals with the nature, scope, and sources of knowledge. To understand the epistemological relation between cognitive functionalism and mechanical thinking, we need to delve into their theoretical and historical origins, as well as how they inform our understanding of the mind and cognition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cognitive functionalism emerged in the mid-20th century as a reaction to behaviorism, which dominated psychology at the time. Behaviorism posited that mental states were not scientifically observable, and therefore, should not be part of scientific inquiry. Functionalism, on the other hand, focused on the mental processes and functions that underlie behavior, emphasizing that the mind is an information-processing system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Functionalism has strong connections to computationalism, the idea that the mind can be understood as a computational system, akin to a computer. This perspective aligns with mechanical thinking, which dates back to ancient Greece and has evolved over time. Mechanical thinking posits that natural phenomena, including mental processes, can be explained through the principles of mechanics, such as cause and effect.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Historically, mechanical thinking began with philosophers like Democritus, who proposed that the world is composed of indivisible atoms governed by mechanical laws. This idea was further developed by Descartes, who proposed that the universe, including living organisms, operates like a machine. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Newton's laws of motion and the development of classical mechanics further solidified mechanical thinking as a dominant worldview in science and philosophy. This mechanistic perspective influenced the development of cognitive functionalism, as it provided a framework for understanding mental processes through the lens of computational systems and information processing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The epistemological relation between cognitive functionalism and mechanical thinking is that both aim to understand and explain mental processes through objective, systematic, and quantifiable methods. Cognitive functionalism builds on the foundation of mechanical thinking by treating the mind as a complex information-processing system, often drawing parallels to computers and other machines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In cognitive functionalism, mental processes and states are explained in terms of their function and the way they process information, rather than their physical or biological makeup. This idea shares an epistemological connection to mechanical thinking, as both seek to uncover the underlying principles and operations governing mental phenomena, often through the use of formal models and computational simulations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, cognitive functionalism and mechanical thinking share an epistemological relation that stems from their common goal of understanding the mind and cognition through systematic, quantifiable, and objective means. Cognitive functionalism builds on the historical foundations of mechanical thinking by applying the principles of information processing and computational systems to the study of mental processes. Both approaches aim to provide a rigorous and mechanistic account of the mind, contributing to our overall understanding of cognition and the nature of knowledge.""</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"">The global consequences of an excessive functionalist and mechanical rationality on our societies</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Me</strong>: ""What are the systemic and global consequences of an excessive functionalist and mechanical rationality on our societies?""<br><br><strong>ChatGPT4</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""An excessive functionalist and mechanical rationality can have several systemic and global consequences on our societies. While these approaches have been instrumental in driving advancements in science, technology, and industry, they can also lead to unintended negative consequences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some potential consequences of an excessive functionalist and mechanical rationality include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Reductionism: Overemphasis on breaking down complex phenomena into simpler components can lead to a reductionist view of reality. This reductionism might cause us to overlook important interactions and emergent properties that arise from the complexity of social and natural systems.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Dehumanization: A mechanistic worldview can result in a dehumanized perspective, treating individuals as mere components of a larger system rather than as unique, conscious beings. This can lead to a disregard for the subjective experiences and emotions of people, affecting social relationships and ethical considerations.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Environmental degradation: The focus on efficiency, productivity, and technological progress can contribute to the exploitation of natural resources and environmental degradation. The mechanistic view may treat the environment as a mere resource to be used, rather than as a complex, interconnected ecosystem that needs to be protected and preserved.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Alienation: The emphasis on rationality and quantification can lead to feelings of alienation and disconnection from our inner selves, nature, and others, reducing the importance of subjective experiences, intuition, and empathy in decision-making processes.</li>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"">How can the Enactive paradigm help re-harmonizing the balance?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Me</strong>: ""Compare the preceding with an enactive rationality (Francisco Varela).""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>ChatGPT4</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""In contrast, Francisco Varela's enactive approach offers an alternative perspective on rationality, cognition, and the relationship between the mind and the environment. The enactive approach, rooted in phenomenology and first-person experience, emphasizes the following aspects:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Embodiment: Enactive rationality highlights the importance of the body in cognition, asserting that our thinking is deeply grounded in our physical experiences and interactions with the world. This view recognizes the role of emotions, sensations, and intuition in shaping our understanding of reality.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Embeddedness: The enactive approach posits that cognition is not an isolated process occurring solely within the brain but is instead embedded within and influenced by the broader social, cultural, and environmental contexts.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Emergence: Enactive rationality acknowledges the complexity of natural and social systems and the emergent properties that arise from the interactions between their components. This perspective values the importance of understanding phenomena holistically rather than reducing them to their constituent parts.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Co-creation: The enactive approach emphasizes the role of individuals in co-creating their reality through their interactions with the environment and other living beings. This perspective recognizes the importance of human agency, values, and ethics in shaping the world.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By comparing the potential consequences of excessive functionalist and mechanical rationality with the enactive approach, we can see that the enactive perspective offers a more holistic and human-centered understanding of cognition, reality, and our relationship with the environment. The enactive approach encourages a greater appreciation for the complexity and interconnectedness of natural and social systems, the role of subjective experiences, emotions, and embodiment in shaping our understanding of the world, and the importance of ethical considerations in our actions and decisions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The systemic and global consequences of adopting an enactive rationality might include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Greater emphasis on well-being: By valuing subjective experiences and emotions, an enactive approach could lead to a greater focus on mental health, happiness, and overall well-being in societal decision-making processes.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Holistic problem-solving: Addressing complex global challenges, such as climate change, poverty, and social inequality, may benefit from the enactive approach's appreciation for emergent properties and the interconnectedness of systems. This could result in more comprehensive and sustainable solutions.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Ethical and value-based considerations: The recognition of human agency and co-creation of reality in the enactive approach can lead to greater emphasis on ethical considerations and values in decision-making processes, promoting social responsibility and accountability.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Improved social cohesion: By acknowledging the importance of social and cultural contexts in cognition, the enactive approach could foster greater understanding and empathy among individuals from diverse backgrounds, promoting social cohesion and inclusivity.""</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""fontSize"":""large""} -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"">Summary</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""In summary, while functionalist and mechanical rationality have been key drivers of scientific and technological progress, their excessive focus can lead to negative consequences, such as reductionism, dehumanization, environmental degradation, and alienation. The enactive approach, as proposed by Francisco Varela, offers an alternative perspective that values embodiment, embeddedness, emergence, and co-creation. Adopting enactive rationality could result in a greater emphasis on well-being, holistic problem-solving, ethical considerations, and social cohesion, ultimately promoting more sustainable, inclusive, and human-centered societies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it is essential to recognize that neither approach should be taken to an extreme, as each has its merits and limitations. Striking a balance between functionalist-mechanical rationality and enactive rationality can lead to a more nuanced understanding of the world and enable us to address complex global challenges more effectively, while also fostering a deeper connection with ourselves, others, and the environment.""</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Me</strong>: ""How can we use Martin Heidegger's ""attunement"" to understand the origin of the actual meaning crisis (John Vervaeke)?""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""To use Martin Heidegger's concept of ""attunement"" to understand the origin of the actual meaning crisis, as discussed by John Vervaeke, we can explore how the background moods and existential situations in contemporary society have influenced people's experiences and understanding of meaning in their lives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Technological and informational overload: The rapid advancement of technology and the information age have led to an overwhelming amount of information and stimuli, which can make it difficult for individuals to maintain a clear sense of purpose and meaning. This informational overload might contribute to a general attunement of anxiety, disorientation, or a sense of being lost in the face of endless possibilities and options.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Loss of traditional structures: As traditional social, religious, and cultural frameworks have weakened in modern society, many people find themselves without the guidance and support these structures once provided. The loss of these shared frameworks can create a pervasive attunement of uncertainty and disconnection, contributing to the meaning crisis as individuals struggle to construct coherent narratives for their lives.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Consumerism and materialism: The rise of consumerism and materialism as dominant cultural values can create an attunement focused on acquiring material possessions and wealth, rather than cultivating deeper connections, personal growth, or spiritual development. This attunement might contribute to a sense of emptiness and dissatisfaction, as the pursuit of external markers of success does not necessarily lead to a meaningful and fulfilling life.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Fragmentation and isolation: The increasing fragmentation and isolation in contemporary society, resulting from factors such as urbanization, individualism, and the erosion of communal life, can lead to an attunement characterized by loneliness, disconnection, and alienation. This can exacerbate the meaning crisis as individuals struggle to find meaningful relationships and connections in their lives.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By examining the various attunements in modern society, we can gain a better understanding of how the background moods and existential situations have contributed to the current meaning crisis. Recognizing these factors can help us address the underlying issues and seek solutions that promote a more meaningful, authentic, and fulfilling way of life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>John Vervaeke's work on the meaning crisis provides complementary insights and potential pathways for cultivating meaning and overcoming the crisis. By combining insights from Heidegger's attunement and Vervaeke's work on relevance realization, cognitive science, and wisdom cultivation, we can develop a more holistic understanding of the meaning crisis and explore ways to foster a more meaningful existence in the contemporary world.""<br><br></p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"">Martin Heidegger's ""attunement"" vs John Vervaeke ""Relevance Realization""</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Me: ""What is Martin Heidegger 'attunement'? Compare it to John Vervaeke Relevance Realization.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ChatGPT4:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""Martin Heidegger's concept of ""attunement"" (Stimmung or mood) is a central aspect of his existential philosophy, particularly as it appears in his magnum opus, ""Being and Time."" Attunement, for Heidegger, refers to the fundamental way in which we find ourselves in the world, the pre-reflective and pre-conceptual background mood that shapes our experience and understanding of our existence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Heidegger posits that our attunement is not merely an individual or subjective phenomenon but rather discloses the world in a certain way, revealing its significance and meaning. In other words, our mood discloses our existential situation and determines our openness to or concealment of certain aspects of reality. Heidegger emphasizes that our attunement is often concealed and overlooked because it is so deeply embedded in our everyday experiences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>John Vervaeke's concept of ""relevance realization"" is a key element of his cognitive science-based framework for understanding meaning-making and wisdom cultivation. Relevance realization is the process by which our cognitive systems dynamically and adaptively select, organize, and integrate information to construct meaningful experiences, solve problems, and navigate the world. It involves the ongoing, real-time adjustment and fine-tuning of our attention, perception, and cognition to maximize our ability to engage with what is most relevant and important in a given context.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While both Heidegger's attunement and Vervaeke's relevance realization address aspects of human experience and meaning-making, they stem from different intellectual traditions and emphasize different aspects. Heidegger's attunement is rooted in existential philosophy and focuses on the affective, pre-reflective background that shapes our understanding of our existence and world. In contrast, Vervaeke's relevance realization is grounded in cognitive science and concentrates on the cognitive processes by which we construct meaning and navigate the complexities of our environment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite these differences, there are some connections between the two concepts. Both Heidegger and Vervaeke emphasize the importance of context in shaping human experience and understanding. Attunement affects how we disclose and engage with the world, while relevance realization involves the adaptive selection and organization of information in response to contextual demands. Additionally, both thinkers recognize that human experience is not static but is rather an ongoing, dynamic process of engagement with the world.""</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"">Scybernethic(s) as a phenomenology of Gesture</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Me: ""Imagine a thinking framework, let's call it ""scybernethics"" or second-order enaction, that posit that gesture agency and attention are the roots an homeostatic approach of meaning and affective valence. Compare it to the two preceding conceptions. What does it imply about the search for scientific objectivity and truth?""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ChatGPT4:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""""Scybernethics"" or second-order enaction, as a hypothetical thinking framework, proposes that gesture agency and attention form the basis of a homeostatic approach to meaning and affective valence. This framework suggests that our actions, gestures, and the direction of our attention play a crucial role in determining our experience of meaning and affect. In essence, scybernethics emphasizes the importance of the active, embodied, and dynamic nature of human cognition and experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When compared to Heidegger's attunement and Vervaeke's relevance realization, scybernethics seems to share some common ground. All three frameworks highlight the significance of context and the dynamic, adaptive nature of human experience. Heidegger's attunement focuses on the affective, pre-reflective background that discloses our existential situation, while Vervaeke's relevance realization deals with the cognitive processes that construct meaning and adapt to contextual demands. Scybernethics, on the other hand, emphasizes the role of embodied action and attention in shaping meaning and affect.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of the search for scientific objectivity and truth, scybernethics could have several implications. Firstly, by emphasizing the role of embodied action and attention, scybernethics suggests that our understanding of the world is intrinsically tied to our active engagement with it. This perspective challenges the traditional assumption that scientific objectivity can be achieved by detaching the observer from the observed.</p>

<p>Secondly, the focus on the dynamic and adaptive nature of meaning and affect implies that scientific objectivity and truth are not static, fixed entities but are rather contingent on the evolving context and the active role of the observer. This view is consistent with contemporary perspectives on scientific inquiry, which emphasize the importance of considering the historical, cultural, and social context in which scientific knowledge is produced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, by highlighting the importance of gesture agency and attention, scybernethics implies that the search for scientific objectivity and truth is not merely a cognitive process but also involves affective and embodied aspects. This perspective encourages a more holistic and integrative approach to scientific inquiry, which acknowledges the complex interplay between cognitive, affective, and embodied factors in shaping our understanding of the world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, scybernethics suggests that the pursuit of scientific objectivity and truth is deeply intertwined with the dynamic, embodied, and contextual nature of human experience. This perspective can enrich our understanding of scientific inquiry by encouraging a more nuanced and integrative approach to the study of the natural world.""</p>

<p>You will understand that the traditional scientific way of thinking is exemplified by the dominant, orthodox and intellectual ""Cognitivism"", that the so-called ""Deep Learning"" techs are just one intermediary (""(neo)Connexionist"") way of seeing cognition, and that all these could be integrated into a <em>comprehensive, embodied and situated approach</em>: ""<a href=""https://iep.utm.edu/enactivism/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Enaction</a>"". </p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size""><a></a> Clarifications <a></a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This essay was written for the purpose of providing a minimal common ground for discussion. It is, of necessity, an ambitious attempt to give a concise account of the various current ideas on the origin of meaning in living and artificial systems in such a way that it is accessible to an interdisciplinary audience, and yet substantive enough to produce debate among the specialists. I apologize at the outset to both groups for passages that will seem irritatingly simple or too abstruse. <a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also I have restrained myself to basic or ‘lower’ cognitive abilities, that is, issues closer to perception, motion, and simple learning. This is in contrast to ‘higher’ cognitive abilities, issues closer to language and reasoning. <a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This presentation cannot be neutral and my preferences are quite explicitly laid out in the text. In particular, in this essay I will argue that the kingpin of cognition is its capacity for <em>bringing forth </em>meaning: information is not pre-established as a given order, but regularities emerge from a co-determination of the cognitive activities themselves. </p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size""><a></a> Outline <a></a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cognitive Science (CS) is a little over 40 years old. It is not established as a mature science with a clear sense of direction and a large number of researchers constituting a community, as is the case of, say, atomic physics or molecular biology. Accordingly, the future development of CS is far from clear, but what has already been produced has had a profound impact, and this will continue to be the case. But progress in the field is based on daring conceptual bets (somewhat like trying to put a man on the moon … without knowing where the moon is). For the sake of concreteness, the federation of disciplines I take here as forming cognitive science today are neuroscience, artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, linguistics, and epistemology. <a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-235"">❮︎</a>Page&nbsp;236<a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-237"">❯︎</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main purpose of this background paper is to provide an X-ray picture of the current state of affairs of CS, in regards to perception and the origin of meaning. Now, like anybody who has ever examined a scientific discipline with any proximity, I have found the cognitive sciences to be a <em>diversity </em>of semi-compatible visions, and not a monolithic field. Further, as any social activity, it has poles of domination so that some of its participating voices acquire more force than others at different periods of time. This is strikingly so in the modern cognitive science revolution which was heavily influenced through some lines of research, particularly in the USA. My bias here is to emphasize diversity. <a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I will proceed in four stages which are conceptually and practically quite distinct. These four stages are the following: <a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Stage 1: A glance at the foundational years (1943-1953);</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Stage 2: Symbols: The cognitivist paradigm;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Stage 3: Emergence: alternatives to symbol manipulation;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Stage 4: Enaction: alternatives to representations.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through this four-tiered description and their articulations we will examine the basis of what is already established as a clear trend (Stages 1 and 2), and the fact that this established paradigm coexists with a wider spectrum of perspectives (Stages 3 and 4). This challenging heterodoxy has the potential for deep changes. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""fontSize"":""large""} -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading has-large-font-size""> 2. A glance at the foundational years </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We start with a brief look into the roots of these ideas in the decade 1943-1953, so as to touch on the issues of direct relevance for us here. <a>[Note 1]</a> In fact, virtually all the themes in active debate today were already introduced in these formative years, evidence that they are deep and hard to tackle. The ‘founding fathers’ knew very well that their concerns amounted to a new science, and christened it with a new name: <em>cybernetics. </em>This name is not in current use any more, and many cognitive scientists today would not even recognize the family connection. This is not idle. It reflects the fact that to become established as a science, in its clear-cut cognitivist orientation (Stage 2 in this text), the future cognitive science had to sever itself from its roots; more complex and fuzzier, but also richer. This is often the case in the history of science: it is the price of passing from an exploratory stage to becoming a research program – from cloud to crystal.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size""><a></a> The fruits of the cybernetics movement <a></a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The cybernetics phase of CS produced an amazing array of concrete results, apart from its long-term (often underground) influence. Some of these are: <a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>the use of mathematical logic to understand the operation of the nervous system;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>the invention of information processing machines (as digital computers), thus laying the basis for artificial intelligence;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>the establishment of the meta-discipline of system theory, which has had an imprint in many branches of science, such as engineering (system analysis, control theory), biology (regulatory physiology, ecology), social sciences (family therapy, structural anthropology management, urban studies), and economics (game theory);</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>information theory as a statistical theory of signal and communication channels;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>the first examples of self-organizing systems.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The list is impressive: we tend to consider many of these notions and tools as an integral part of our lives. Yet they were all inexistent before this formative decade, and they were all produced by intense exchange among people of widely different backgrounds: a uniquely successful interdisciplinary effort. </p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size""><a></a> Logic and the science of mind <a></a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The avowed intention of the cybernetics movement was to create a <em>science of mind. </em>To its readers, the mental phenomena had been for far too long in the hands of psychologists and philosophers, and they felt themselves called to express the processes underlying mental phenomena in explicit mechanisms and mathematical formalisms <a></a><a>[Note 2]</a><a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the best illustrations of this mode of thinking (and its tangible consequences) was the seminal: ‘A logical calculus immanent in nervous activity <a>[Note 3]</a> (1943), paper by McCulloch and Pitts. Several major leaps were taken in this article. First, proposing that <em>logic </em>is the proper discipline with which to understand the brain and mental activity. Second, seeing the brain as a device which <em>embodies </em>logical principles in its component elements of neurons. Each neuron was seen as a threshold device being either active or inactive. Such simple neurons <a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-236"">❮︎</a>Page&nbsp;237<a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-238"">❯︎</a> could then be connected to one another, their interconnections performing the role of logical operations so the entire brain could be regarded as a deductive machine. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These ideas were central for the invention of the digital computers. <a>[Note 4]</a> At that time, vacuum tubes were used to implement the McCulloch- Pitts neurons, where today we find silicon chips, but modern computers are still built on the same von Neumann architecture. This major technological breakthrough also laid the basis for the dominant approach to the scientific study of mind that was to crystallize in the next decade as the cognitivist paradigm. </p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3,""fontSize"":""normal""} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size""><a></a> The end of an era <a></a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was, of course, a lot more to this creative decade. For instance, the debate about whether logic was indeed sufficient to understand the brain, because it neglected its distributed qualities. Alternative models and theories were put forth, which for the most part were to lay dormant until revived to constitute an important alternative for CS in the 1970s (Stage 3). By 1953, in contrast to their initial vitality and unity, the main actors of the cybernetics phase were distanced from each other and many died shortly thereafter. The idea of mind as logical calculation was to be continued. <a></a></p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3,""fontSize"":""normal""} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size""><a></a> Enter the cognitivists <a></a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just as 1943 was clearly the year in which the cybernetics phase was born, so was 1956 clearly the year which gave birth to the second phase of CS. During this year, at two meetings held at Cambridge and Dartmouth, new voices (like those of Herbert Simon, Noam Chomsky, Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy) put forth ideas which were to become the major guidelines for modern cognitive science. <a>[Note 5]</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The central intuition is that intelligence (including human intelligence) so resembles a computer in its essential characteristics that cognition can be <em>defined </em>as computations of symbolic representations. Clearly this orientation could not have emerged without the basis laid during the previous decade, and evoked in the previous section. The main difference is that one of the many original tentative idea is promoted here <a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-237"">❮︎</a>Page&nbsp;238<a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-239"">❯︎</a> to full blown <em>hypothesis, </em>with a strong desire to set its boundaries apart from its broader, exploratory, and interdisciplinary roots where the social and biological sciences figured preeminently with all their multifarious complexity. <em>Cognitivism</em><a> [Note 6]</a> is a convenient label for this large but well-delineated orientation, that has motivated many scientific and technological developments since 1956, in all the areas of cognitive science. </p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size""><a></a> An outline of the doctrine <a></a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The cognitivist research program can be summarized as answers to the following questions: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Question # 1: </em>What is cognition:<a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Answer: </em>Information processing: Rule-based manipulation of symbols.<a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Question # 2: </em>How does it work?<a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Answer: </em>Through any device which can support and manipulate discrete physical elements: the symbols. The system interacts only with the form of the symbols (their physical attributes), not their meaning.<a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Question # 3: </em>How do I know when such a cognitive system is functioning adequately?<a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Answer: </em>When the symbols appropriately represent some aspect of the real world, and the information processing leads to a successful solution of the problem posed to the system.<a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Obviously the cognitivist program as outlined above did not come out ready-made, like Athena from the head of Zeus. We are presenting it with the benefits of 30 years of hindsight. However, not only has this bold research program become fully established, but even today is <em>identified </em>by many with cognitive science itself, although this is changing rapidly. Until very recently, only a few among its active participants, let alone in the public at large, were sensitive to its roots or its current challenges and alternatives. “The brain processes information from the outside world” is a household phrase understood by everybody. It is odd to treat statements such as this as problematic rather than obvious, and the ensuing conversation will immediately be labeled as being <a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-238"">❮︎</a>Page&nbsp;239<a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-240"">❯︎</a> ‘philosophical’. This is a <em>blindness </em>in contemporary common sense introduced in our culture after the establishment of cognitivism. </p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size""><a></a> What cognitivism has wrought: Artificial intelligence <a></a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The manifestations of cognitivism are nowhere more visible than in artificial intelligence, which is the <em>literal construal </em>of the cognitivist hypothesis. Over the years many interesting theoretical advances and technological applications have been made within this orientation: expert systems, robotics, image processing. These results have been widely publicized, and we need not insist on examples here. <a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because of its wider implication, however, it is worth noting that AI and its cognitivist basis has reached a dramatic climax in Japan’s ICOT Fifth Generation Program. For the first time since the war there is a national plan concerting the efforts of industry, government, and universities. The core of this program – the rocket to be put on the moon by 1992 – is a cognitive device capable of understanding human language, and of writing its own programs when presented with a task by an untrained user. Not surprisingly, the heart of the ICOT program is the development of a series of interfaces of knowledge representation and problem solving based on PROLOG, a high level programming language for predicate logic. The ICOT program has triggered immediate responses from Europe and in the USA, and there is little question that this is a major commercial and engineering battlefield. However, what concerns us here is not whether the rocket will be built or not, but whether it points where the moon is. More about this latter. <a></a></p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The cognitivist hypothesis finds its most literal construal in AI. Its complementary endeavor is the study of natural, biologically implemented cognitive systems, most especially man. Here, too, computationally characterizable representations have been the main explanatory tool. Mental representations are taken to be occurrences of a formal system, and the mind’s activity is what gives these representations their attitudinal color: beliefs, desires, plans, and so on. Here, therefore, unlike AI, we find an interest in what the <em>natural </em>cognitive systems are really like, and it is assumed that their cognitive representations are <em>about </em>something <em>for </em>the system, they are intentional. <a>[Note 7]</a><a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-239"">❮︎</a>Page&nbsp;240<a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-241"">❯︎</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A good example of this orientation of research is the following. Subjects were presented with geometric figures and asked to rotate them in their heads. They consistently reported that the difficulty of the task depended on the number of degrees of freedom in which the figure had to be rotated. That is, everything happens as though we have a mental space where figures are rotated like on a television screen. <a>[Note 8]</a> In due time these experiments produced an explicit theory postulating rules by which the mental space operates, similar to those used on computer displays operating on stored data. These researchers proposed that there is an interaction between language-like operations and picture-like operations, and together they generate our internal eye. <a>[Note 9]</a> This approach has generated an abundant literature, both for and against, <a>[Note 10]</a> and every level of the observations has been given alternative interpretations. However, the study of imagery is a perfect example of the way the cognitivist approach proceeds when studying mental phenomena. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another equally important effect of cognitivism is the way it has shaped current views about the brain. Over the years almost all of neurobiology (and its huge body of empirical evidence) has become permeated with the information-processing perspective. More often than not, the origins and assumptions of this perspective are not even questioned. <a>[Note 11]</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best example of this approach is given by the celebrated studies on the visual cortex, where one can detect electrical responses from neurons when the animal is presented with a visual image. It was reported early on that it was possible to classify these cortical neurons as ‘feature’ detectors, responding to certain attributes of the object being presented: its orientation, contrast, velocity, color, and so on. <a>[Note 12]</a> In line with the cognitivist hypothesis, these results were seen as giving biological substance to the notion that the brain picks up visual information from the retina through the feature specific neurons in the cortex, and the information is then passed on to later stages in the brain for further processing (conceptual categorization, memory associations, and eventually action). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In its most extreme form, this view of the brain is expressed in Barlow’s <a>[Note 13]</a> grandmother cell doctrine, where there is a correspondence <a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-240"">❮︎</a>Page&nbsp;241<a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-242"">❯︎</a> between concepts or percepts and neurons. (This is the AI equivalent of detectors and labeled lines.) </p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CS-as-cognitivism is a well-defined research program, complete with prestigious institutions, journals, applied technology and international commercial concerns. Most of the people who work within CS would subscribe – knowingly or unknowingly – to cognitivism or its close variants. After all, if one’s bread and butter consists in writing programs for knowledge representation, or finding neurons for well-defined tasks, how could it be otherwise? For our concerns here, it is important to draw attention to the depth of this <em>social commitment </em>from a large sector of the research community in CS. We now focus on the dissent, taking two basic forms: </p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size""><a></a> The roots of self-organization ideas <a></a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alternatives to the towering dominance of logic as the main approach to CS had already been proposed and widely discussed during the formative decade. At the Macy Conferences, for example, it was argued that in actual brains there are no rules or central logical processor nor is information stored in precise addresses. Rather, brains seem to operate on the basis of massive interconnections, in a distributed form, so that their actual connectivity changes as a result of experience. In brief, they present a self-organizing capacity that is nowhere to be found in logic. In 1958 F. Rosenblatt built the Perceptron, a simple device with some capacity for recognition, purely on the basis of the changes of connectivity among neuron-like components; <a>[Note 14]</a> similarly, W. R. Ashby carried out the first study of the dynamics of very large systems with random interconnections, showing that they exhibit coherent global behaviors. <a>[Note 15]</a><a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-241"">❮︎</a>Page&nbsp;242<a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-243"">❯︎</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>History would have it that these alternative views were bracketed out of the intellectual scene in favour of the computational ideas discussed above. It was only during the late 70s that an explosive rekindling of these ideas took place – after 30 years of preeminence of the cognitivist orthodoxy; what D. Dennett <a>[Note 16]</a> has called High Church Computationalism. Certainly one of the contributing factors for this renewed interest was the parallel rediscovery of self-organizational ideas in physics and non-linear mathematics. </p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size""><a></a> Motivation to look for an alternative <a></a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The motivation to take a second look at self-organization was based on two widely acknowledged deficiencies of cognitivism. The first is that symbolic information processing is based on <em>sequential </em>rules, applied one at the time. This famous von Neumann bottleneck is a dramatic limitation when the task at hand requires large numbers of sequential operations (such as natural image analysis or weather forecasting). A continued search for <em>parallel </em>processing algorithms on classical architectures has met with little success because the entire computational philosophy runs precisely counter to it. <a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second important limitation is that symbolic processing is <em>localized: </em>the loss of any part of the symbols or rules of the system implies a serious malfunction. In contrast a <em>distributed </em>operation is highly desirable, so that there is at least a relative equipotentiality and immunity to mutilations. <a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These two deviations from cognitivism can be phrased as the same: the architectures and mechanisms are far from biology. The most ordinary visual tasks, done even by tiny insects, are done faster than is physically possible when simulated in a sequential manner; the resiliency of the brain to damage without compromising all of its competence, has been known to neurobiologists for a long time. <a></a></p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size""><a></a> What is emergence? <a></a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The above suggests that instead of focusing on symbols as a starting point, one could start with simple (non-cognitive) components which would connect to one another in dense ways. In this approach each component operates only in its <em>local </em>environment, but because of the network quality of the entire system, there is global cooperation which <a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-242"">❮︎</a>Page&nbsp;243<a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-244"">❯︎</a><em> emerges </em>spontaneously, when the states of all participating components reach a mutually satisfactory state, without the need for a central processing unit to guide the entire operation. <a>[Note 17]</a> This passage from local rules to global coherence is the heart of what used to be called self- organization during the foundations years. <a>[Note 18]</a> Today, different people prefer to speak of emergent or global properties, network dynamics, or even synergetics. Although there is no unified formal theory of emergent properties, the most obvious regional theory is that of attractors in dynamical systems theory. <a>[Note 19]</a> These are not the property of an individual components, but of the entire system, yet each component contributes to its emergence and characteristics. </p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size""><a></a> A change of perspective concerning the brain <a></a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recent work has produced some detailed evidence of how emergent properties are at the core of the brain’s operation. This is hardly surprising if one looks at the details of the brain’s anatomy. For example, although neurons in the visual cortex do have distinct responses to specific ‘features’ of the visual stimuli, as mentioned above, this is valid in an anesthetized animal with a highly simplified (internal and external) environment. When more normal sensory surroundings are allowed, and the animal is studied awake and behaving, it has been shown that and the stereotyped neuronal responses previously described become highly context sensitive. For example, there are distinct effects produced by bodily tilt <a>[Note 20]</a> or auditory stimulation. <a>[Note 21]</a> Further, the neuronal response characteristics depend directly on neurons localized far from their receptive fields.<a>[Note 22]</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thus, it has become increasingly necessary to study neurons as members of <em>large ensembles </em>which are constantly disappearing and arising through their cooperative interactions, and where every neuron has multiple and changing responsiveness to visual stimulation, depending on context. Even at the most peripheral end of the visual system, the influences that the brain receives from the eye is met by more activity that <em>descends </em>from the cortex. It is by the encounter of these two ensembles of neuronal activity that a new coherent configuration emerges, depending on the match : mismatch between the sensory activity and the ‘internal’ setting at the cortex. <a>[Note 23]</a> In general, an individual neuron participates in many such global patterns and bears little significance when taken individually. <a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-243"">❮︎</a>Page&nbsp;244<a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-245"">❯︎</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although these examples are taken from the domain of vision for the sake of contrast with the example of the previous section, several other detailed analysis have proliferated recently. <a>[Note 24]</a> We do not need to insist on this point further. </p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size""><a></a> The (neo)connectionist strategy <a></a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The brain has been (once more) a main source of metaphors and ideas for other fields of CS in this alternative orientation. Instead of starting from abstract symbolic descriptions, one starts with a whole army of simple stupid components, which, appropriately connected, can have interesting global properties. These global properties are the ones that embody/express the cognitive capacities being sought. <a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The entire approach depends, then, on the introduction of the appropriate connections and this is usually done through a rule for gradual <em>change </em>of connections starting from a fairly arbitrary initial state. Several such rules are available today, but by far the most explored is Hebb’s Rule, whereby changes in connectivity in the brain could arise from the degree of <em>coordinated </em>activity between neurons: if two neurons tend to be active together, their connection is strengthened; otherwise it is diminished. Therefore the system’s connectivity becomes inseparable <em>from its history of transformation, </em>and related to the kind of task defined for the system. Since the real action happens at the level of the connections, the name <em>(neo)connectionism </em>has been proposed for this direction of research.’ <a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the important factors for the explosive interests in this approach today was the introduction of some effective methods to follow network changes, most notably statistical measures which provide the system with a global ‘energy’ function that assures its convergence. <a>[Note 26]</a> For instance, take <em>N </em>simple neuron-like elements, connect them reciprocally, and provide them with a Hebb-type rule. Next present this system with a succession of (non-correlated) patterns at some of its nodes, and at each presentation let the system reorganize itself by rearranging its connections following its energy gradient. After the learning phase, when the system is presented again with one of these patterns, it recognizes it, in the sense that it falls into a unique attractor, and internal configuration that is said to represent the learned item. The recognition is possible provided the number of patterns presented is not larger than about 0.15<em>N</em>. Furthermore, the system <a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-244"">❮︎</a>Page&nbsp;245<a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-246"">❯︎</a> performs a correct recognition even if the pattern is presented with added noise, or the system is partially mutilated. <a>[Note 27]</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another important technique favored by some researchers is back- propagation [used today in so-called ""Deep Learning""]: changes in neuronal connections inside the network (hidden units) are assigned so as to minimize the difference between the network’s response and what is expected of it, much like somebody trying to imitate an instructor. <a>[Note 28]</a> NetTalk, a celebrated recent example of this method, is a grapheme-phoneme conversion machine that works by being shown a few pages of English text in its learning phase. As a result, NetTalk can read out loud a new text, in what many listeners consider deficient but comprehensible English. <a>[Note 29]</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Connectionist models provide, with amazing grace, a working model for a number of basic cognitive capacities, such as rapid recognition, associative memory and categorical generalization. The current work with this orientation is justified on several counts. First, cognitivist AI and neuroscience had few convincing results to account for or reconstruct some of the cognitive performances just described. Second, these models are quite close to biological systems, and this means that one can work with a degree of integration between AI and neuroscience that was hitherto unthinkable Finally, the models are general enough to be applied, with little modification, to a variety of domains [cf. today's LLMs/""ChatGPT"", Big Data, etc]. </p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size""> Exeunt the symbols </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the most interesting aspects of this alternative approach to CS in that symbols, in their conventional sense, play no role. This entails a radical departure from a basic cognitivist principle: the physical structure of symbols, their form, is forever separated from what they stand for, their meaning. This separation between form and meaning was the master stroke that created the computational approach, but it also implies a weakness when addressing cognitive phenomena at a deeper level. How do symbols <em>acquire </em>their meaning? Whence this extra activity which is, by construction, not in the cognitive system? <a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In situations where the universe of possible items to be represented is constrained and clear-cut (such as when a computer is being programmed, or when an experiment is conducted with a set of predefined visual stimuli), the assignment of meaning is clear. Each discrete physical item within the cognitive system is made to correspond to an external item (its referential meaning), a mapping operation which the observer easily provides. Remove these constraints, and the form of the symbol is <em>all </em>that is left, and meaning becomes a ghost, as it would if we were to contemplate the bit patterns in a computer whose operating manual was lost. <a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the connectionist approach, meaning is linked to the overall performance (say in recognition or learning). Hence, meaning relates to the global state of the system, and is not located in a particular symbols. The form/meaning distinction at the symbolic level disappears, and reappears in a different garb: the observer provides the correspondence between the system’s global state and the world it is supposed to handle. This, is, then, a radically different way of working with representations. We shall return to this issue below. <a></a></p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading has-large-font-size""><a></a> 5. Linking symbols and emergence <a></a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At this stage the obvious question to consider is the <em>relation </em>between the symbolic and emergent views on the origin of simple cognitive properties. The obvious answer is that these two views should be <a></a><a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-246"">❮︎</a>Page&nbsp;247<a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-248"">❯︎</a> complementary top-down and bottom-up approaches, or that they should be pragmatically adjoined in a some mixed mode, or simply used at different stages. A typical example of this move is to describe early vision in connectionist terms, say up to primary visual cortex, but to assume that at the inferotemporal cortex level, the description should be based on symbolic programs But the conceptual status of such synthesis is far from clear, and concrete examples are still lacking. <a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In my view the most interesting relation between emergent and symbolic descriptions is one of <em>inclusion, </em>that is, the view of symbols as a higher level of description of properties embedded in an underlying distributed system. The case of the so-called genetic code is paradigmatic, and I will use it here for concreteness. For many years biologists considered protein sequences as being instructions coded in DNA. However, it is clear that DNA triplets are capable of predictably specifying an aminoacid in a protein if and only if they are embedded in the cell’s metabolism, that is, in the midst of thousands of enzymatic regulations in a complex chemical network. It is only by the emergent regularities of such network as a whole that we can bracket out this metabolic background, and treat triplets as codes for aminoacids. In other words, the symbolic description is possible at another level of description. Clearly, it is possible to treat such symbolic regularities in their own right, but their status and interpretation is quite different than if taken at face value, with independence of the substratum from which they arise. <a>[Note 30]</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The example of genetic information can be transposed directly to the cognitive networks with which neuroscientists and connectionist deal. In fact, some researchers have recently expressed this point of view. <a>[Note 31]</a> In Smolensky’s ""Harmony theory"" <a>[Note 32]</a> for example, fragmentary atoms of ‘knowledge’ about electrical circuits linked by distributed statistical algorithms, yields a model of intuitive reasoning in this domain. The competence of this whole system can be described as doing inferences based on symbolic laws, but their performance sits at a different level and is never achieved by reference to a symbolic interpreter. This point is graphically portrayed in Figure 1. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thus, a fruitful link between a less orthodox cognitivism, relaxed to emerge from parallel distributed processing provided by self-organizational approaches is a concrete possibility, especially in engineering- oriented AI. This potential complementation will undoubtedly produce visible results, and might well become the dominant trend for many years in CS. <a></a><a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-247"">❮︎</a>Page&nbsp;248<a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-249"">❯︎</a><a></a></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This move is, of course, inadmissible from a strict or orthodox cognitivist position. <a>[Note 33]</a> Among the many issues that change from the emergence viewpoint, two of them are worth underlining here. First, the question of the origin of a symbol and its signification (i.e. why does ATI code for alanine?) has at least a clear way to approach it. Second, any symbolic level becomes highly dependent on the underlying network’s properties and peculiarities, and bound to is history. A purely procedural account of cognition, independent of its embodiments and history, is, therefore, seriously questioned. These two issues take us straight into our last stage. </p>

<p>It is tempting to stop in an analysis of today’s CS with just the two approaches already discussed. But this would be inadequate, since in both orientations (and hence some future synthesis) some essential dimensions of cognition would be <em>still </em>missing. We need to keep in mind a larger horizon for CS, born from a deeper dissatisfaction than the search for alternatives to symbols, and closer to the very foundation of representational systems. Hopefully this orientation, enjoying today some breathing space, will not suffer the same fate as that of earlier self-organization ideas, left to be rediscovered after 30 years. <a></a></p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size""><a></a> Insisting on common sense <a></a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The central dissatisfaction of what we here call the enactive alternative is simply the complete absence of common sense in the definition of cognition so far. Both in cognitivism (by its very basis) and in present day connectionism (by the way it is practiced), it is still the case that the criteria for cognition is a successful representation of an external world which is pre-given, usually as a problem solving situation. However, our knowledge activity in everyday life reveals that this view of cognition is too incomplete. Precisely the greatest ability of all living cognition is, within broad limits, to <em>pose </em>the relevant issues to be addressed at each moment of our life. They are not pre-given, but <em>enacted or brought forth </em>from a background, and what counts as relevant is what our common sense sanctions as such, always in a contextual way. <a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-249"">❮︎</a>Page&nbsp;250<a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-251"">❯︎</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a critique of the use of the notion of representation as the core of CS, since only if there is a pre-given world can it be represented. If the world we live in is brought forth rather than pre-given, the notion of representation cannot have a central role any longer. The depth of the assumptions we are touching here should not be underestimated, since our rationalist tradition as a whole has favored (with variants of course) the understanding of knowledge as a mirror of nature. It is only in the work of some continental thinkers (most notably M. Heidegger, M. Merleau-Ponty and M. Foucault) that the explicit critique of representations, and the enactive dimension of understanding has begun. These hermeneutical themes were first introduced as the discipline of the interpretation of ancient texts, but has now been extended to denote the entire phenomenon of <em>interpretation </em>understood as the activity of enactment or bringing forth, to which we are alluding. <a>[Note 34]</a> Since we are concerned here with the dominance of usage, instead of with representations, it is appropriate to call this alternative approach to CS <em>enactive</em>. <a>[Note 35]</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In recent years, however, a few researchers within CS have put forth concrete proposals, taking this critique from the philosophical level into the laboratory and into specific work in AI. This is a more radical departure from CS than the preceding one, and one that goes beyond the themes discussed during the formative period. At the same time, it naturally incorporates the ideas and methods developed within the connectionist context, as we shall presently see. <a></a></p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size""><a></a> The problem with problem solving <a></a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The assumption in CS has all along been that the world can be divided into region of discrete elements and tasks to which the cognitive system addresses itself, acting within a given ‘domain’ of problems: vision, language, movement. Although it is relatively easy to define all possible states in the ‘domain’ of the game of chess, it has proven less productive to carry this approach over into, say, the ‘domain’ of mobile robots. Of course, here too one can single out discrete items (such as steel frames, wheels and windows in a car assembly). But it is also clear that while the chess world ends neatly at some point, the world of movement amongst objects does not. It requires our continuous use of common sense to configure our world of objects. <a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, what is interesting about common sense is that it cannot be <a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-250"">❮︎</a>Page&nbsp;251<a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-252"">❯︎</a> packaged into knowledge at all, since it is rather a readiness-to-hand or know-how based on lived experience and a vast number of cases, which entails an embodied history. A careful examination of skill acquisition, for example, seems to confirm this point. <a>[Note 36]</a> A lived, natural world does not have sharp boundaries, and thus we expect a symbolic representation with rules, to be unable to capture common-sense understanding. In fact, it is fair to say that by the 1970s, after two decades of humblingly slow progress, it dawned on many workers in CS that even the simplest cognitive action requires a seemingly infinite amount of knowledge, which we take for granted (in fact it is so obvious as to be invisible), but which must be spoon-fed to the computer. The cognitivist hope for a general problem-solver in the early 60s, had to be shrunk down to local knowledge domains with well-posed problems to be solved, where the programmer could project onto the machine as much of his/her own background knowledge as was practicable. Similarly, the commonly practiced connectionist strategy depends on restricting the space of possible attractors by means of assumptions about known properties of the world which are incorporated as additional constraints for regularization, <a>[Note 37]</a> or, more recently, in back propagation methods as a perfect model to be imitated. In both instances, the unmanageable ambiguity of background common sense is left at the periphery of the inquiry, hoping that it will be clarified in due time. <a>[Note 38]</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Such acknowledged concerns have a well-developed philosophical counterpart. Phenomenologists of the continental tradition have produced detailed discussions as to why knowledge is a matter of being in a world which is inseparable from our bodies, our language and social history. <a>[Note 39]</a> It is an ongoing interpretation which cannot be adequately captured as a set of rules and assumptions since it is a matter of action and history, an understanding picked up by imitation and by becoming a member of an understanding which is already there. Furthermore, we cannot stand outside the world in which we find ourselves, to consider how its contents match their representations of it: we are always already immersed in it. Positing rules as mental activity is factoring out the very hinge upon which the living quality of cognition arises. It can only be done within a very limited context where almost everything is left constant, a pervasive <em>ceteris paribus </em>condition. Context and common sense are not residual artifacts that can be progressively eliminated by the discovery of more sophisticated rules. They are in fact the very essence of <em>creative </em>cognition. <a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-251"">❮︎</a>Page&nbsp;252<a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-253"">❯︎</a></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If this critique is correct, even to some limited degree, progress in understanding cognition as it functions normally (and not exclusively in highly constrained environments) will not be forthcoming unless we are to start from another basis than a domain out-there to be represented. <a></a></p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The real challenge posed to CS by this orientation is, then, that it brings into question the most entrenched assumption of our scientific tradition altogether: that the world as we experience it is independent of the knower. Instead, if we are forced to conclude that cognition cannot be properly understood without common sense, and this is none other than our <em>bodily and social history, </em>the inevitable conclusion is that knower and known, subject and object, stand in relation to each other as mutual specification: they arise together. <a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Consider the case of vision: which came first, the world or the image? The answer of vision research (both cognitivist and connectionist) is unambiguously given by the names of the tasks investigated: to ‘recover shape from shading’ or ‘depth from motion’, or ‘color from varying illuminants’. This we may call the <em>chicken </em>extreme: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Chicken </em>position: The world out-there has fixed laws, it precedes the image that it casts on the cognitive system, whose task is to capture it appropriately (whether in symbols or in emergent states). <a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, notice how very reasonable this sounds, and how difficult it seems to imagine that it could be otherwise. We tend to think that the only alternative is the <em>egg </em>position: <a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Egg </em>position: The cognitive system creates its own world, and all its apparent solidity is the primary reflection of the internal laws of the organism. <a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The enactive orientation proposes that we take a middle way, <a>[Note 40]</a> moving beyond these two extremes by realizing that (as farmers know) egg and chicken <em>define each other, </em>they are co-relative. It is the ongoing process of living which has shaped our world in the back-and-forth between what we describe as external constraints from our perceptual perspective and the internally generated activity. The origins of this process are for ever lost, and our world is for all practical purpose stable (… except when it breaks down). But this apparent stability need <a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-252"">❮︎</a>Page&nbsp;253<a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-254"">❯︎</a> not obscure a search for the mechanisms that brought them forth. It is this emphasis on co-determination (beyond chicken and egg) which marks the difference between the enactive viewpoint and any form of constructivism <a>[Note 41]</a> or biological neo-Kantism. <a>[Note 42]</a> This is important to keep in mind, since the more or less realist philosophy that pervades cognitive science will tend to assume that anybody who questions representations must <em>ipso facto </em>be in the antipodal position where the spectre of solipsism also lives. </p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size""> Color and smell as examples </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The preceding considerations are usually made in the realm of language and human communications, and it would seem that for the more immediate perceptual world they would not be relevant. But the whole point is that enaction applies at <em>all </em>levels. Thus examining perception at this light is important. <a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Consider the world of colors that we perceive every day. It is normally assumed that color is an attribute of the wavelength of reflected light from objects that we pick it up and process it as relevant information. In fact, as has now been extensively documented, the perceived color of an object is largely independent of the incoming wavelength.’“ Instead, there is a complex (and only partially understood) process of cooperative comparison between multiple neuronal ensembles in the brain, which specifies the color of an object according to the global state it reaches: a perceptual chromatic space is specified.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, clearly these mechanism are consistent with what we describe as illumination constraints (reflectance, object discontinuity, and so on) but they are not a <em>logical </em>consequence of them. The cooperative neuronal operations underlying our perception of color, have resulted from the long biology evolution of the primate group. Their effects are so pervasive to our life that it is tempting to assume that colors, as we see them, is the way the world <em>is. </em>But this conclusion is tempered if we remember that other species have evolved different chromatic worlds by performing different cooperative neuronal operations from their sensory organs. For example, the pigeon’s chromatic space is apparently tetrachromatic (requires four primary colors), in contrast to us trichromats (where only three primary colors suffice). <a>[Note 45]</a> This is not a merely expansion in diversity within the same spectrum, but an entirely <a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-253"">❮︎</a>Page&nbsp;254<a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-255"">❯︎</a> new dimension which brings forth a chromatic world as incommensurable to ours as ours is to a daltonic person. Color here appears not as a correlate of world properties, but as regularities which are co-defined with a particular mode of being. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What can be said is that our chromatic world is <em>viable: </em>it is effective since we have continued our biological lineage. The vastly different histories of structural coupling of birds, insects, and primates have brought forth a world of relevance for each inseparable from their living. All that is required is that each path taken is viable, i.e. be an uninterrupted series of structural changes. The neuronal mechanisms underlying color are not the solution to a ‘problem’ (picking up the correct chromatic properties of objects), but the arising together of color perception <em>and </em>what one can then describe as chromatic attributes in the world inhabited. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another perceptual dimension where these ideas can be seen at play is olfaction, not due to the comparative span provided by phylogeny, but due to novel electrophysiological techniques. Over many years of work, Freeman” has managed to insert an array of electrodes into the olfactory bulk of a rabbit so that a small portion of the global activity can be measured while the animal behaves freely. It was found that there is no clear pattern of global activity in the bulb unless the animal is exposed to one specific odor several times. Further, such emerging patterns seem to be created out of a background of incoherent activity into a coherent attractor. As in the case of color, smell reveals itself not as a passive mapping of external traits, but as the creative dimensioning of meaning on the basis of history. <a>[Note 47]</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this light, then, the brain’s operation is centrally concerned with the constant enactment of worlds through the history of viable lineages; an organ laying down worlds, rather than mirroring. <a></a></p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The basic notion, then, is that cognitive capacities are inextricably linked to a history that is lived, much like a path that does not exist but is laid down in walking. Consequently, the view of cognition is not that of solving problems through representations, but as a creative bringing forth of a world where the only required condition is that it is <em>effective action: </em>it permits the continued integrity of the system involved. <a>[Note 48]</a><a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-254""> ❮︎</a>Page&nbsp;255<a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-256"">❯︎</a></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It should be noted that two notions surface in these answers that are usually absent from considerations in CS. One is that, since representations no longer play a central role, intelligence has shifted from being the capacity to solve a problem to the capacity to <em>enter </em>into a shared world. The second is that what takes the place of task-oriented design is an <em>evolutionary </em>process. Bluntly stated, just as much as connectionism grew out of cognitivism inspired by a closer contact with the brain, the enactive orientation takes a further step in the same direction to encompass the temporality of living either in ontogeny and phylogeny. <a></a></p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading has-normal-font-size""><a></a> Working without representations <a></a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seeking alternatives to representation to study cognitive phenomena (and this is, admittedly, a vague umbrella, much as connectionism is) attracts a relatively small group of people in diverse fields. Further, as I shall argue in the next section, many of the tools of traditional connectionist perspective can be re-formulated in this context, so the divisory lines are much less sharp here than they were between the symbolic and connectionism orientations. <a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is clear that an enactive strategy for AI is feasible only if one is prepared to relax the constraints of a specific problem solving performance. This is the spirit, for example, of the so-called classifier systems, <a>[Note 49]</a> conceived to confront an undefined environment which it has to shape into significance. More generally, simulations of prolonged histories of coupling with various evolutionary strategies permit to <a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-255"">❮︎</a>Page&nbsp;256<a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-257"">❯︎</a> discover trends wherein cognitive performances arise <a>[Note 50]</a> But these new perspectives for research are only at their earliest beginnings. </p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading has-large-font-size""><a></a> 7. Linking emergence and enaction <a></a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The link between emergence and enaction depends on changing one’s reading of what a distributed system can do. If one emphasizes how a historical process leads to emergent regularities without a fixed final constraint, one recovers the more open-ended biological condition. If one emphasizes, instead, how a given network will acquire a very specific capacity in a very definite domain (i.e. NetTalk), then representations are back in, and we have the more usual take on connectionist models. However, the first interpretation also entails a whole new different perspective on what cognition is, as outlined in the previous section. <a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thus the road taken is strongly dependent on the degree of interest to stay closer to biological reality, and further away from a pragmatic-engineering considerations. Of course, defining a fixed domain within which a connectionist system can function is possible, but it obscures the deeper issues about origin so central to the enactive viewpoint. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Consider for example Smolensky’s Harmony theory. His viewpoint of sub-symbolic computation as a model for intuition seems eminently in line with an enactive perspective, which is why it can serve as the best case to consider here for contrast. However, even Harmony theory is evaluated in reference to an unviolated level of environmental reality: exogenous features matching given features of the world, and endogenous activity which acquire through experience a state of abstract meaning that “optimally encode environmental regularity.” The hope is to find endogenous activity which corresponds to an “optimality characterization” of the surroundings. <a>[Note 51]</a> The enactive perspective would require taking this kind of cognitive system into a situation where endogenous and exogenous are mutually definitory through a prolonged history requiring only a viable coupling, and eschewing any form of optimal fitness. <a>[Note 52]</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Granted, from the standpoint of a pragmatically oriented AI, having as objective the production of a system that works in some domain in short delay, this orientation seems pointless. My argument is that cognitive properties emerged in living systems without such optimality considerations. They result from histories of viable compensations that <a></a><a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-256"">❮︎</a>Page&nbsp;257<a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-258"">❯︎</a> create regularities, but it is far from obvious that they can be said to correspond to some unique referent. <a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thus, there is a tension between the two parallel worlds of research, where the choice for or against the enactive critique is taken according to all the complexities of a conceptual shift, and the technological world, where the straight-jacket of immediate applicability sets the limits on how far it is able to extend itself. It seems to me that this tension will probably be resolved by a widening gap between the technological and the scientific components of CS. <a>[Note 53]</a></p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We started from the hard-core of CS and moved towards what might be considered its periphery, that is, the consideration of surrounding context, and effects of the biological and cultural history on cognition and action. Of course, those who hold on to representations as a key idea, see these concerns as only temporarily outside of the more precise realm of problem-solving orientation that seems more accessible; others go as far as to take the position that such ‘fuzzy’ and ‘philosophical’ aspects should not even enter into a proper cognitive science. <a></a></p>

<p>As a visual summary of this presentation I have outlined the three main directions discussed here in a <em>polar map </em>of Figure 2. My view is <a></a><a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-257"">❮︎</a>Page&nbsp;258<a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-259"">❯︎</a> that these three successive waves to understand basic cognition and its origin relate to each other by successive <em>imbrication, </em>as Chinese boxes. In the centripetal direction, one goes from emergence to symbolic by bracketing the base from which symbols emerge, and working with symbols at face value. Or one can go from enaction to a standard connectionist view by assuming given regularities of the domain where the system operates (i.e. a fitness function in a domain). The centrifugal direction is a progressive bracketing of what seems stable and regular, to consider where such regularities could have come from, up to and including perceptual dimensions of our human world. <a></a></p>

<p>Figure 2: A polar map of STC, having the cognitivist paradigm at the center and the alternative themes as fringe, both touching the double-edged body of connectionist ideas. Along the disciplinary radii, some names of workers in each representative area.<a></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is clear that each one of these approaches, as levels of descriptions, are useful in their own context. However, if our task is to understand <a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-258"">❮︎</a>Page&nbsp;259<a href=""https://cepa.info/2074#Page-260"">❯︎</a> the origin of perception and cognition as we find them in our actual lived history, I think that the correct level of explanation is the most inclusive outer rim of the map. Further, for an AI where machines are intelligent in the sense of growing into a common sense with human beings as animals can do, I can see no other route but to bring them up through a process of evolutionary transformations as suggested in the enactive perspective. <a>[Note 54]</a> How fertile, how difficult, or how impossible this will prove to be, is anybody’s guess. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My preferences have been quite explicitly laid out in the text. In particular, in this essay I have argue that, if the kingpin of cognition is its capacity for bringing forth meaning, then information is not pre-established as a given order, but it amounts to regularities that emerge from the cognitive activities themselves. It is this re-framing that has multiple ethical consequences, which should be evident by now. As pointed out in the last item of our table above, to the extent that we move from an abstract to a fully embodied view of knowledge, facts and values become <em>inseparable. </em>To know <em>is </em>to evaluate through our living, in a creative circularity.</p>

<p>Since my arrival on TW six months ago, I have been confirming (converging with many bright people), that we can agree now without catastrophism that we are very likely in what could be called a ""systemic meta-crisis"" (climate, energy, bio-ecology, politics, meaning, attention…) sign of a <em>major (western) civilizational transition</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are all together, with you, looking to understand and find adequate resolutions. But this is a deep and complex subject and rushing too much on easy obvious takes won't be the solution, at the risk of making more bad than good. We leave in a time when words meaning, this crystalized common wisdom legacy, is on the verge of being rogued by limited and eager interests, spoiling <em>our precious common noospace</em> (See Michel Bauwens work about the <a href=""https://primer.commonstransition.org/4-more/michel-bauwens-on-the-commons-transition"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">""commons"" transition</a>) .</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From my own analysis (<a href=""https://scybernethics.org/scybernethics-enaction-cognitive-rationality-second-order-cybernetics/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Scybernethics</a>): roughly, our growing civilization has conquered it's stability and well-being, the ""progress"", in the last two thousand years with in an expanding movement linking materialist objectivist abstraction (""science"") and technologies, a crucial subject nowadays, but also an epistemological blind-spot. <a href=""https://consilienceproject.org/technology-is-not-values-neutral-ending-the-reign-of-nihilistic-design-2/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Technologies are not values neutral</a> (Zak Stein). At the heart of this progress lye the ""<a href=""https://scybernethics.org/exploring-future-rationality-age-chatgpt-enaction-functionalism-mechanization-mind/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">mechanical thinking</a>"". <em>We are immersed in a <a href=""https://scybernethics.org/whence-perceptual-meaning-a-cartography-of-current-ideas-varela-f-j-1992/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">thinking styles</a> battle, a cognitive peaceful fight.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But we have now reached a personal and collective limit and what was virtuous, <strong>in it's excess</strong>, is now becoming a deadly poison. We are at the end of an extractive economy cycle who's last frontier, after others cultures, nature, and our own body gestures (industrial machines) is today, in the digital age, capturing and exploiting our intimate cognitives abilities and <a href=""https://scybernethics.org/scybernethics-enaction-cognitive-rationality-second-order-cybernetics/#514_Technologies_as_externalized_and_encapsulated_gestures"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">cognitive inner gestures</a>. Memory, reasoning, language, attention, desire... It's ultimate target, what is presently lacking in the golem-machine, is now <em>our most intimate creative sense and meaning-making competence</em>s. <em>Understanding is now becoming paramount.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So what to do? It is a pharmakological (Bernard Stiegler) question: how to heal this collective madness which has also it's deep historical roots in us, as in the background and implicitly, this historical trajectory has also been the constitution of our modern ""self"", of our self-perception as somehow ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI5FMj5D9zU"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">free individuals</a>"" separated from nature? This is <a href=""https://scybernethics.org/scybernethics-enaction-cognitive-rationality-second-order-cybernetics/#34_From_dialectics_tension_to_dialogics_thinking_coping_homeostatically_and_patiently_with_conceptual_dipoles"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>the key paradox</strong> that we must face</a>, without loosing our mind, without loosing our heart, without loosing our soul. How to remember what has been lost in these techno-scientific cuts and shifts, the precious wisdom knowing, and being able to transition together by the top <em>without throwing the baby out with the bathwater, which would be equally catastrophic</em>; indeed everyone is confronted today with maddening psychological <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bind"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">paradoxes and double binds</a> (Bateson) which seems to annihilate our reflection towards more and more action. But action without understanding is vain as understanding without action is also sterile (the proof in the pudding!).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hear many voices asking, like a noble incantation, for a collective transcendence. And no doubt, we have been socially and technologically atomized, divided, <strong>analysed</strong> and urged to face our own present solitude in the multiplicity, the more cruelly than we are legitimately refusing to participate to this no-more-human global dynamic. <em>So better coordination and cooperation is a requirement, without forgetting that it is also our differences and differAnces which enrich us</em>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the real question is how did we drift into this vulnerable state? Without <strong>understanding</strong> we will be condemned to repeat the past. And naming scapegoats doesn't seem really deep to me. We also need to reach inside and remember how much all human beings and becoming, and more generally all living creatures, shares so much more than they differs. Any of us won't be here without others, our parents, our friends, our feeding. <em>This is the heart path which open.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But collectivity, even if it can become virtuous and generate emancipatory emergences beyond the individuals who compose it, has no body. The ""social body"", from a personal and pragmatic perspective is precious but seems intellectually an abstract creation, not an a priori for our modern self, and a renewed and regenerated democratic institutional ""<strong><a href=""https://www.academia.edu/43027437/Bernard_Stiegler_Elements_for_a_General_Organology_2020_"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">organology</a></strong>"" (Greek organon 'instrument' and logos, Stiegler) is required. More, the historical coherence is being destroyed by time-shifting synchronizing technologies and propaganda (Cf. Fukuyama), at the risk of irrational and gregarious emotional contagions. Our integrative and metaphorical ""rational social body"" need, like ourselves, the slow coherence and consistence of the socio-historical fabric to regenerate our collective rationality, that is to say social meaning. <em>Not only cognitive, we are also immersed in a temporal fight.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since <strong>social and personal meanings are deeply entangled</strong>, in a bottom-up style which should <strong>compose</strong> with its top-down counterpart, I think that it is our responsibility now that each one of us share it's own honey after having patiently reflected and weight it's thinking with the alder of tradition: we should never forget that we are also standing <a href=""https://scybernethics.org/whence-perceptual-meaning-a-cartography-of-current-ideas-varela-f-j-1992/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">on the shoulders of giants</a> and it would be stupid madness not to use the keys they bequeathed to us, sometimes at the heavy price of many sacrifices. But we should be pertinent as there is too much noise which drown out relevant voices. <em>The necessary normative social truth feeds on intelligent diversity, not on an impulsive hubbub</em>.</p>

<p>This document synthesizes some core concepts, methodologies, and critiques central to Scybernethics, a framework developed by Christophe Rigon (also known as Soto²). Scybernethics is presented as a personal and philosophical journey that explores cognition, technology, and the nature of understanding itself, integrating elements of cybernetics, enaction, phenomenology, and critical philosophy. It seeks a ""second-order rationality²"" that is self-reflective, embodied, and aware of its own limitations.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Key Themes and Ideas</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">1. Second-Order Thinking &amp; Rationality²</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Beyond First-Order</strong>: Rigon argues that traditional, first-order thinking focuses on the what of knowledge, whereas second-order thinking is about the how of knowing. He explains that “second-order thinking involves reflecting on the concept, the conceptualization, and the conceptualizer (self), unlike direct first-order thinking.” This self-awareness is critical to recognizing cognitive biases.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>No True Third-Order</strong>: Rigon believes there is no true ""third-order"" thinking because the process remains a first-person experiential cycle between phenomenological (1st person) and objective (3rd person) perspectives. The process loops back on itself, rather than leading to a higher level of abstraction. “The ambijective gesture is a lived first person experiential cycling gesture between first (phenomenological) and third person (valid intersubjective/objective perspectives).”</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Rationality²</strong>: In scybernethics, ""rationality²"" is not just about logical deductions but encompasses a broader ""aesthetic feeling"" tied to biocognitive homeostasis. It's a ""second-order ana-logic ratio (ratio²)"" that includes how we regulate our own regulations.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">2. Enaction and Embodiment</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>""All Knowing is Being""</strong>: Scybernethics is grounded in the idea that knowledge is not separate from the knower; ""all knowing is being"" and ""the enaction of understanding is the understanding of enaction"". Understanding is an active, embodied process.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Existential Inquiry</strong>: Enaction is not just a cognitive theory but also a method for self-transformation. It is viewed as a ""aesthetic of self,"" a way of knowing oneself and growing personally.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Mind as a Gesture</strong>: Rigon often speaks of the ""mind as a gesture"", a concept linked to his understanding of Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) models, and a driving idea for his attention toward his psychomotricity.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Emphasis on the Processual</strong>: He focuses on the processual dimension of meaning making. The ""processual"" is what remains when ""form"" is subtracted, a dynamic and unobjectifiable element essential for generating meaning. Form, on the other hand, is anything that can be designated/indicated.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">3. Conceptual Dipoles and Dialogical Thinking</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Conceptual dipoles are pairs of terms (e.g., form/process, inside/outside, logic/analogic) that are complementary or appear in opposition. They are used as analytical tools.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Asymmetry</strong>: Rigon emphasizes the asymmetrical nature of these dipoles, with one term (often the ""formal"" one) being easier to define or quantify than the other (often the ""processual"" one). “A first phenomenological observation is the observation of the asymmetry of grasping polarities: one of the concepts can generally be more easily 'seized' by a precise definition, a quantification than the other.”</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Focus on the ""Weaker"" Side</strong>: A key method in scybernethics is to emphasize the more difficult polarity of the dipole. By engaging with the ""weaker"" side, one gains a fuller understanding of the dipole and resists the bias toward the easily formalizable. “Rigon emphasizes focusing on the 'weaker' side of the dipole because it represents the aspect more difficult to grasp, promoting a deeper understanding by attending to what is not easily formalized.”</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>""Exploratory Dialectical Dialogic""</strong>: This method of exploring dipoles involves understanding the two concepts distinctly, their complementarity, and their contexts, and putting the tension in ""suspension of judgement.""</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Internal Gesture</strong> <strong>(enkinaesthesia)</strong>: The evaluation of conceptual dipoles often involves an ""internalized gesture of weighing"", as if holding the semantic weight of each pole, allowing a feeling of difference to emerge. ""It is real com-putation.""</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">4. The ""Ambijective Gesture""</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Cyclical Process</strong>: It’s a core concept describing a cycling between culturally deployed objectification and phenomenological subjectification. “It is the self-conscious co-determination of (meta)epistemological understanding and body-based meaning-making which is critical to the way we make sense of ourselves.”</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Co-determination</strong>: This gesture is the ""self-conscious co-determination"" of meta-epistemological viewpoints and embodied meaning-making. The ambijective gesture creates a self-referential process linking the subject, object and the meta-understanding.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">5. Technology and Computation</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Experimental and Experiential Epistemology</strong>: Computer models and simulations are viewed as experimental and experiential tools for self-understanding. Rigon uses the computer not to create artificial intelligence but to make his own thinking process more visible and comprehensible.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>""<a href=""https://scybernethics.org/from-computers-which-think-to-computers-which-make-me-think-the-tekhnicus-sedimentation/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">From Computers which Think to Computers which Make me Think</a>""</strong> (Bachimont): This phrase captures Rigon's view of computer use, emphasizing that the primary value of computation is in enhancing human understanding and self-reflection, not in replicating human intelligence.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Critique of ""Technology-by-Itself""</strong>: He is critical of the notion that technology is neutral or self-operating, arguing that it reflects human biases and agendas. Rigon emphasizes that the human element is key.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Computation as an Aesthetic Operation</strong>: Rigon describes ""<a href=""https://scybernethics.org/the-art-of-com-putation-intuition-balance-and-second-order-logic/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">com-putation</a>"" as a ""ana-logic"" (analogic and logic) and situated meaning-making transformative operation"". It's an aesthetical operation rooted in synchronic sensorimotor evaluation.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Double Cut</strong>: Rigon describes ""the double cut of the digital"" as ""the cut to meaning, which is reduced, and the cut to matter, which is abstract.” (Bachimont), leading to what he called <a href=""https://scybernethics.org/scybernethics-transduction-unveiling-the-double-cuts-in-modern-science-and-the-digital-age/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">""transduction"" between forms and processes</a>.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">6. Dia-Grams</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Quasi-Bidimensionality (DimenTionality)</strong>: Dia-grams are a ""second-order spacialized/formalized double conceptual dipole"" representing the form/process and 1st/3d person perspective matrix.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>""Not Three, Not Four""</strong>: This phrase highlights the dia-gram's quasi-dimensionality, referring to the fact that the forms/process and first-person/third-person perspectives intersection is self-reflexive and recursive, and a duration needs to be introduced.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Stiegler's ""Gramme""</strong>: Rigon’s ""dia-gram"" terminology is influenced by Stiegler's concept of ""gramme"", defined as an interruption of a flux to make it reproducible and calculable. Dia-gram is a tool to help with self-interpretation.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">7. Critique of Western Rationality</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Mechanical Rhythm</strong>: Rigon critiques a ""mechanical rhythm"" in Western thinking, where ""form"" precedes ""process,"" leading to the ""objectification fallacy,"" ignoring the role of the observer-actor. He warns that the emphasis on ""form to process, representation to function"" leads to a limited rationality.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Dangers of Mechanization</strong>: He sees dangers in the mechanization of thought and social structures, recognizing that the same type of thinking that creates technology can also create negative consequences. He describes a ""global western rationality crisis"" and a ""schismogenesis"" of systemic positive feedback loops.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Objectification Fallacy</strong>: He describes a “tendency to ignore or bury the observer-actor and focus on the formal object.”</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">8. Scybernethics as a Regulatory Paradigm</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Reflective Practice</strong>: Scybernethics is framed as a reflective practice to regulate distinctions in how we understand the world.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Iterative &amp; Cyclic</strong>: Rigon’s methodology is deeply iterative and cyclic, constantly returning to revise concepts through phenomenological exploration, technological simulation, and reflection.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Emphasis on Process</strong>: It highlights the importance of the ""processual dimension"", the unobjectifiable, dynamic aspect of experience.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scybernethics represents a unique approach to understanding the interconnectedness of cognition, technology, and self-awareness. Through a focus on second-order thinking, the exploration of conceptual dipoles, and a deeply embodied approach to knowledge acquisition, it provides a framework to critique and refine our understanding of ourselves and the world around us. Rigon's work challenges traditional notions of objectivity, advocating instead for an approach that is reflective, dynamic, and always aware of its own situatedness. He urges the creation of a “second order philo-techno-scientific rationality coupled to a democratic bio-techno politics of citizens” to navigate our current challenges.</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Definition and Nature</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Conceptual dipoles</strong> are pairs of linguistic terms (notions or concepts) that are either complementary or in opposition to each other. Examples include ""linearity/circularity,"" ""form/process,"" ""inside/outside,"" ""logic/analogic,"" ""localized/distributed,"" and ""intentionality/agency"". They also include ""third person / first person point of views"" and ""natural sciences / humanities and social sciences"".</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>These dipoles are not merely abstract ideas, but are recognized as structuring disciplinary theories and cognitive domains.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>A fundamental <strong>phenomenological characteristic</strong> of conceptual dipoles is their <strong>asymmetrical nature</strong>. One term is typically easier to define and formalize, while the other is more elusive, ""soapy"", and difficult to grasp. For instance, in the ""explanation/understanding"" dipole, explanation is more readily formalized, while understanding is more difficult to pin down.</li>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Practical Role in Scybernethics Methodology</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Highlighting Tensions and Complexities</strong>: Conceptual dipoles are used to explore tensions and complexities in thought. They help to <em>reveal the limitations and blind spots</em> of each perspective by showing that each side of the dipole highlights a different approach to understanding a concept.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Focus on the ""Weaker"" Side:</strong> Scybernethics emphasizes an ethical self-imperative to focus attention on the ""weaker"" side of the dipole. This is the side that is more difficult to grasp and formalize. By focusing on the ""weaker"" side, a deeper understanding is achieved by pushing on one's cognitive limits and attending to what is not easily formalized. This approach helps to counteract bias toward simpler, more easily formalized concepts.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Exploratory Dialectical Dialogic:</strong> This is a systematic method of exploring conceptual dipoles by understanding the two concepts distinctly, their complementarity, and their contexts. It involves understanding each term separately, seeing how they complement each other, and examining the contexts in which they appear.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Suspension of Judgement:</strong> Rather than forcing a synthesis, the tension between the two poles of the dipole is temporarily held in suspension. This allows for a more nuanced understanding to emerge over time.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>""Weighing""</strong>: The two elements of a dipole are evaluated by an internalized gesture of ""weighing,"" as if the semantic values of each pole were assimilated to a mass held in each internal ""hand"". This allows one to indicate a difference or preference. It's a form of real ""com-putation"" in scybernethics, which is an analogic and situated meaning-making transformative operation.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Iterative Process</strong>: The exploration of conceptual dipoles is part of an iterative process in scybernethics, which involves cycles between theory and practice, knowledge and self-reflection, and computer simulations and phenomenological inquiry.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Hermeneutic/heuristic circulation</strong>: This iterative process of exploration leads in time to the enaction of a co-determining <em>circular and recursive comprehensive 1P-3P logic</em> exemplified by the second-order Logic² where distinctions are both <em>mono-dimensional AND hierarchical (second-order distinctions²)</em>. <br><br>N.B.: This last point is a tool to understand the important relation between the objectivist natural sciences epistemology (3P-Only) and the observer-actor integrated one of human and social sciences, phenomenology and techno-philosophy playing here a <em>bridging transjective role</em>.</li>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Second-Order Thinking</strong>: Conceptual dipoles are explored using second-order thinking, which involves reflecting on the concept itself, the process of conceptualization, and the conceptualizer (the self). By applying second-order thinking, scybernethics avoids reducing the dipole to a one-dimensional perspective.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Ambijective Gesture</strong>: Conceptual dipoles are related to the ambijective gesture, which is a cyclical process between cultural objectification and phenomenological subjectification. The exploration of conceptual dipoles through the ambijective gesture allows for a deeper integration of subjective experience and objective understanding.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Processual DimenTion</strong>: The emphasis on the ""weaker"" side of the dipole aligns with the scybernethics focus on the ""processual dimenTion,"" which is what remains when form is subtracted (it is a non-defining <em>negative</em> operation). The processual dimenTion is unobjectifiable, dynamic like an existential flux, and vital for generating meaning and allowing its vital and crucial circulation (""meaning and sense-making must flow""). Conceptual dipoles are a tool that can help to bring attention to this unobjectifiable ""processual dimenTion"" by providing a contrasting ""formal"" element.</li>

<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Quasi-bidimensionality</strong>: Conceptual dipoles are also connected to the idea of quasi-bidimensionality and the <em>dia-gram</em>. The form/process dipole is a key conceptual dipole and a major theme of scybernethics, relating to the hermeneutical and heuristical circulation between 1st and 3rd person perspectives. This is represented in a dia-gram, which is a second-order spatialized/formalized double conceptual dipole: the form/process 1st/3d PP matrix.</li>

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Critique of Western Rationality</strong>: The use of conceptual dipoles and the emphasis on the ""weaker"" side is part of a larger critique of Western rationality. Scybernethics critiques the tendency of Western thought to prioritize the ""easy"" to formalize side of the dipole, leading to an ""objectification fallacy"" that ignores the observer-actor.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, <strong>conceptual dipoles</strong> are a central tool in scybernethics that facilitates a deeper, more nuanced understanding of complex concepts. They are used to explore the interplay between different perspectives and to resist the tendency towards oversimplification. They also encourage a shift from purely objective or subjective approaches towards a more integrated view of knowledge, understanding that both are necessary for an accurate understanding of the world. By using conceptual dipoles, scybernethics seeks to push the boundaries of traditional thought and explore <em>new possibilities for understanding</em>.</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">A Dynamic, Iterative, and Self-reflexive Methodology</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The scybernethics framework offers a unique approach to addressing the epistemological challenges of integrating first-person phenomenological perspectives (1PP) with third-person Cartesian viewpoints (3PP). It does this through a dynamic, iterative, and self-reflexive methodology. Here's how:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Rejects the primacy of the 3PP</strong>: Scybernethics critiques the traditional Western scientific approach that prioritizes a detached, objective 3PP, arguing that this approach ignores the role of the observer and the richness of lived experience. It posits that the 3PP is socially and biocognitively anchored in the 1PP, not the other way around.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Embraces the 1PP</strong>: In contrast to the 3PP-only perspective, scybernethics gives importance to the first-person perspective, emphasizing the need to integrate subjective experience and embodied awareness into the scientific process. It sees the 1PP as essential for understanding cognition and meaning-making.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Hermeneutical Circulation</strong>: The framework establishes a ""hermeneutical circulation"" between the 1PP and 3PP. This involves a constant back-and-forth between subjective phenomenological inquiry and objective scientific analysis. This circulation is not about synthesizing the two perspectives into one, but rather maintaining a productive tension between them.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Conceptual Dipoles</strong>: Scybernethics employs ""conceptual dipoles"" as a tool to explore the tensions between seemingly opposing concepts, such as form/process, object/subject, or 1PP/3PP. It focuses on the ""weaker"" side of the dipole, not to negate the other, but to gain a deeper, more nuanced understanding.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Ambijective Gesture</strong>: The ""ambijective gesture"" is a cyclical process that moves between culturally deployed objectification and phenomenological subjectification. This gesture involves a self-conscious co-determination of meta-epistemological understanding and body-based meaning-making. This cycling helps in understanding the implicit relation between subject and object.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Second-Order Thinking</strong>: Scybernethics uses second-order thinking, which involves simultaneous consideration of the concept, the process of conceptualization, and the conceptualizer (self). This mode of thinking is essential to understanding the observer's role in the process of knowledge acquisition. It's not just about the concept itself, but also about how the concept is understood and by whom.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Processual Thinking</strong>: Scybernethics emphasizes ""processual thinking,"" understanding concepts as dynamic processes, not static entities. This approach highlights the agency in constructing meaning and understanding concepts as products of interactions and transformations.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Technology as a tool for self-understanding</strong>: Rather than viewing technology as neutral, Scybernethics considers it a tool for deepening self-understanding. Computer simulations are used as ""experimental and experiential epistemology"" to help researchers better understand their own minds and cognitive processes. This perspective shifts the focus from ""computers that think"" to ""computers that make me think"".</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Self-Reflexivity</strong>: By framing theories as ""attentional grids,"" scybernethics explicitly includes the observer in the system being observed, aligning with second-order cybernetics. This is a reflexive process where models shape and are shaped by observations. This encourages awareness of how frameworks shape understanding and promotes exploration of alternative perspectives.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In essence, the scybernethics framework seeks to resolve the tension between 1PP and 3PP by creating a dynamic interplay between the two, leading to a more comprehensive and integrated understanding of cognition and consciousness. It emphasizes that knowledge is not just about objective facts but also about the subjective experience and the active role of the observer in shaping what is known.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Scybernethics vs. Neurophenomenology &amp; Micro-phenomenology: advancing enactive first-person perspectives</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The scybernethics framework distinguishes itself from other approaches like neurophenomenology, micro-phenomenology, and second-person (2PP) interviews through its unique emphasis on self-transformation, its integration of technological hermeneutics, and its broader philosophical scope. While all of these approaches aim to bridge the gap between subjective experience and objective understanding, scybernethics offers a distinct perspective.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a breakdown of how scybernethics compares to these other approaches:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Neurophenomenology</strong>:<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Focus</strong>: Neurophenomenology couples first-person accounts of experience with third-person neurological data, such as brain imaging (EEG). It seeks to find neural correlates of consciousness by linking subjective reports with objective measurements.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Methodology</strong>: It is polarized towards coupling rational dimensions with experimental empiricism. It uses microphenomenological interviews (2PP) to link phenomenological experience with scientific explicitation, searching for invariances with imaging technologies.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Scybernethics Contrast</strong>: Scybernethics, while also valuing the 1PP, is <strong>more philosophically oriented and aims at the active transformation of the observer-actor himself</strong>, rather than just coupling experience with neurological data. It uses computer simulations and (meta)epistemological reflection as tools for self-understanding. Also, while neurophenomenology is more normative, scybernethics is more heuristic and hermeneutical. Scybernethics does not incorporate the neurological dimension and it enhances experience through direct apprehension.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list --></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Micro-phenomenology</strong>:<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Focus</strong>: Micro-phenomenology uses detailed first-person interviews to explore the micro-dynamics of lived experience, aiming to make explicit the implicit structures of consciousness. It often uses ""explicitation interviews"" to access the dynamic micro-structure of lived experience.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Methodology</strong>: It focuses on the detailed exploration of lived experience, trying to make explicit the usually implicit aspects of awareness. It couples first and second person points of view via interviews and meditative practices.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Scybernethics Contrast</strong>: While scybernethics shares an emphasis on first-person experience, it <strong>goes beyond mere description of lived experience</strong>. It integrates this experience with computer simulations, second-order thinking and (meta)epistemological reflection to actively transform the observer’s understanding. Scybernethics is not just interested in describing the micro-structure of experience, but in using it as a starting point for a self-transformative process. Also, scybernethics emphasizes the ""processual dimension"" of meaning making.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list --></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Second-Person (2PP) Interviews</strong>:<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Focus</strong>: 2PP interviews involve direct interaction between the researcher and the subject, aiming to explore the subject's experience through dialogue. It's a method to understand how people make sense of their experiences.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Methodology</strong>: It's a dialogical approach involving the researcher and the subject, focusing on the subject's lived experience through questioning and shared understanding.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Scybernethics Contrast</strong>: Scybernethics uses 2PP interviews but integrates them within a broader framework of self-reflection, technological hermeneutics, and second-order thinking. While 2PP interviews seek to understand the other's perspective, <strong>scybernethics aims for a self-transformation of the observer-actor</strong> by making use of these interviews as a hermeneutical tool among others.</li>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Originality and Interest of Scybernethics</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Emphasis on Self-Transformation</strong>: Unlike the other approaches, scybernethics is explicitly designed to be a tool for self-transformation. It sees the process of understanding as being inextricably linked with the process of personal change and growth. It is an ""aesthetic of self"".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Technological Hermeneutics</strong>: Scybernethics uniquely uses technology, particularly computer simulations, as tools for self-understanding and knowledge acquisition. It's not just about creating artificial intelligence, but about using simulations to reflect on one's own cognitive processes, described as ""experimental and experiential epistemology"". The focus is on “computers which make me think”, rather than “computers which think”.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Second-Order Rationality</strong>: Scybernethics is rooted in second-order cybernetics, focusing on the observer’s role in the system. It introduces the concept of “rationality²” which includes self-awareness and the regulation of one's own cognitive processes. It also makes use of ""conceptual dipoles"" to navigate the tension of opposing concepts.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Iterative Methodology</strong>: Scybernethics employs an iterative and cyclic methodology that combines theory and practice, knowledge and self-reflection, computer simulations and phenomenological inquiry. This continuous loop allows for the constant revision and refinement of concepts.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>""Ambijective Gesture""</strong>: The unique concept of the ""ambijective gesture"" captures the cyclic process between culturally deployed objectification and phenomenological subjectification, providing a way to understand the implicit relation between subject and object.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Critique of Western Rationality</strong>: Scybernethics critiques the limitations of Western rationality, highlighting its tendency to prioritize formalization and objectification over subjective experience and process. It warns against the dangers of a “mechanical rhythm” and “objectification fallacy,” advocating for a more balanced and integrated approach that acknowledges the observer and the ""processual dimension"".</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Summary</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, scybernethics offers a novel and comprehensive approach to bridging the gap between subjective and objective perspectives by incorporating self-transformation, technological hermeneutics, and a second-order mode of thinking. It is a framework that is not only about understanding cognition, but also about actively shaping one's own understanding and way of being in the world. It proposes that ""all knowing is being,"" (von Foerster, Maturana, Varela) emphasizing that understanding is deeply rooted in lived experience and the act of understanding is also the act of experiencing or doing.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Introduction</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scybernethics and Varela's ""cybernetic dialectic"" (Bitbol 2021) both address conceptual dualities, but they do so with different emphases and methodologies. Scybernethics, developed by Christophe Rigon, is an approach that emphasizes a practical, embodied, and self-transformative method of inquiry, while Varela's cybernetic dialectic, particularly as expressed in ""Not one, not two,"" (Varela 1976) is more focused on overcoming dualities through a shift in the logical framework itself. Both approaches involve a move beyond traditional binary logic.<br><br>N.B.: It is interesting to note that while the scybernethics framework was elaborated under the general influence of Varela's enactive paradigm, this particular aspect was developed totally independently (Rigon didn't knew Varela's text at the time), giving rise to an interesting convergent distinction of the two approaches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Here's a comparison of the key aspects:</p>

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Scybernethics Dialectics</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Conceptual Dipoles:</strong> Scybernethics uses ""conceptual dipoles"" (also called dualities, dichotomies, or dialectical opposites) as a central tool for inquiry. These are pairs of terms that are complementary or in opposition, such as form/process, inside/outside, and explanation/understanding. The approach emphasizes working with the tension between these polarities.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Emphasis on the ""Weaker"" Side:</strong> Scybernethics emphasizes focusing on the ""weaker"" side of a conceptual dipole, which is often the more elusive or difficult-to-formalize aspect. By prioritizing the ""weaker parent,"" a deeper understanding of the overall concept is achieved.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Dia-Logic:</strong> Scybernethics employs a ""dia-logic"" approach, which is a way of thinking that goes beyond binary logic. It involves a circulation between first-person (1P) and third-person (3P) perspectives. This circulation aims for a balance or ""homeostatic balancing of proportionality"".</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Second-Order Logic²:</strong> Scybernethics utilizes ""second-order logic²,"" which is not merely the concept of a concept but also includes the conceptualization itself and the concept of the conceptualizer. This involves a self-referential element, recognizing that the observer is part of the system being observed.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Quasi-Bidimensionality:</strong> The concept of ""quasi-bidimensionality"" refers to the idea that concepts can be understood as having two dimensions, one of which is classical and metric while the other is understood through self-referentiality or enacted distributed coherence.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Processual DimenTion:</strong> Scybernethics introduces the notion of the ""processual dimenTion,"" which highlights the dynamic and incalculable aspect of reality that cannot be fully captured by static forms. It is the ""lived time experience"" and is related to the phenomenological experience of an internal gesture.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Suspension of Judgment:</strong> A key step in the Scybernethics methodology is the temporary suspension of judgment, which allows for a deeper understanding and avoids premature conclusions.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Ambijective Gesture:</strong> This is a key element of the Scybernethic approach, defined as a lived first-person experiential cycling gesture between first (phenomenological) and third person (intersubjective/objective) perspectives, to achieve a co-determination of the (meta)epistemological point of view and the experience of body homeostatic meaning-making.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Iterative Process:</strong> Scybernethics emphasizes an iterative approach, meaning that it involves a cyclical process of exploration and refinement. This is in contrast with linear thinking, and influenced by computer science and PDP simulations.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>""Not four, not three"":</strong> This motto is related to the quasi-bidimensionality, expressing that when a formal distinction is made, the relation between the polarities need to be refined through experience.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Varela's Cybernetic Dialectic</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>""Not one, not two"":</strong> This is Varela's famous phrase that encapsulates his approach to overcoming dualities. It suggests moving beyond the limitations of binary thinking (either/or) and towards a more inclusive perspective, by considering that the ""it"" (the form) and ""the process leading to it"" are not two separate things.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Star-Statements:</strong> Varela used ""star-statements"" to indicate how to go from a duality to a trinity. These are conceptual tools to reframe the dualistic framework.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Rejection of Standard Positions:</strong> Varela's approach rejects physicalist monism and property dualism, instead, focusing on a dynamical and participatory view of consciousness and body.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Emphasis on Dynamics:</strong> Varela's approach highlights the dynamic interplay between mind and body, which are seen as complementary levels of organization within a unique dynamics. The mind is considered a ""conversational pattern"" emerging from bodily processors.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Focus on Logical Framework:</strong> Varela's cybernetic dialectic aims to change the very logical framework from which dualities are derived. This involves a shift in how we conceptualize the relationship between mind and body, and also what mind is.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Similarities</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Moving Beyond Dualism</strong>: Both approaches seek to move beyond traditional dualistic thinking. They emphasize that seemingly opposite concepts are not necessarily separate, but rather are interconnected or complementary.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Emphasis on Process:</strong> Both approaches place a strong emphasis on process rather than static forms or objects.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Importance of Experience:</strong> Both methodologies value experience in their approaches. Scybernethics directly uses the first person experience as a way to cycle between the subjective and objective poles of knowledge.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Influence of Cybernetics:</strong> Both are influenced by cybernetics and second-order cybernetics.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Differences</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Methodological vs. Conceptual:</strong> Scybernethics is presented as more of a methodology, a practical way of exploring and understanding the world through conceptual dipoles and a dia-logical, iterative process. Varela's ""cybernetic dialectic"" is more of a conceptual framework for reframing the way dualities are understood.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Self-Transformation:</strong> Scybernethics explicitly aims at the active transformation of the observer-actor, while Varela's approach is more focused on the shift in understanding itself. Scybernethic(s) is the ""enaction of the enactor"".</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Emphasis on First-Person Experience:</strong> Scybernethics places a greater emphasis on first-person experience and the ""ambijective gesture"", while Varela's approach, while acknowledging the importance of experience, is more focused on conceptual and logical shifts.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Formalization:</strong> Scybernethics uses dia-grams to formalize and spatialize conceptual dipoles, using a ""quasi-bidimensional"" approach. Varela's approach doesn't involve such visual tools for formalization, instead, its emphasis is on the logic.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Use of Computer Simulations:</strong> Scybernethics uses computer simulations as a tool to explore cognitive processes, seeing them as extensions of the self. This is not a prominent feature of Varela's dialectic, which relies more on conceptual re-framing.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Second-order Logic:</strong> Scybernethics explicitly defines and uses a ""second-order logic²"" which includes the concept of the conceptualizer, while Varela's ""not one, not two"" can be seen as a starting point for the deconstruction of the first order dualism, but it does not includes the self-referential aspect.</li>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, while both Scybernethics and Varela's ""cybernetic dialectic"" share a common goal of <em>moving beyond traditional dualistic thinking</em>, Scybernethics is a more practically oriented, embodied, iterative, and self-transformative methodology, whereas Varela's approach, particularly his ""Not one, not two"" concept, focuses more on the logical and conceptual reframing of the dualities. Scybernethics, while using Varela's general ideas as a foundation, has developed them in an ""idiosyncratic"" way based on <em>lived experience</em>, including tools such as conceptual dipoles and quasi-bidimensional diagrams, leading to his <strong>second-order logic²</strong>.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Introduction</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <strong>meta-dualist</strong> conceptions of both Scybernethics and Varela's cybernetic dialectic have significant consequences for how the mind-body problem is understood, ultimately reframing it as a ""mind-mind"" problem centered on the scientific observer-actor. Both approaches move beyond the traditional Cartesian dualism of mind and body and the limitations of a third-person perspective to reframe how we understand consciousness.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Consequences for the Mind-Body Problem</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Rejection of Traditional Dualism:</strong> Both Scybernethics and Varela reject the traditional dualistic view of mind and body as separate substances or properties. Instead, they propose a more integrated, dynamic, and participatory understanding. This is not only a theoretical position, but a ""mutation of experience"".</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Emphasis on Process Over Substance:</strong> Rather than viewing mind and body as static entities, these approaches emphasize the dynamic processes and activities through which they emerge. The focus is on how mind and body are enacted and how they mutually constitute each other through a ""structural coupling"".</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Embodied Cognition:</strong> Both approaches highlight the importance of embodiment in understanding cognition. The mind is not seen as separate from the body but as arising from and being shaped by bodily experience and action. The body is not a mere object, but also the ""locus and origin of the process of objectification"".</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Beyond Physicalism:</strong> Both challenge physicalist views that reduce the mind to brain processes. Instead, they view the mind as a higher-level pattern of activity that emerges from the complex interactions of the body with its environment. The relation between mind and body is not a simple one of cause and effect, but of ""tangled dialectics"".</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>The observer-actor is part of the system:</strong> Scybernethics and Varela's cybernetic dialectic recognize that the observer is not separate from the observed system. Therefore, scientific inquiry must include the observer's role in shaping knowledge. This is a key element of second-order thinking.</li>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Focus on the Observer-Actor:</strong> The move to a ""mind-mind problem"" is a recognition that the challenge is not simply understanding the relationship between mind and body, but understanding the relationship between the scientist's own mind and the object of study, which is also a mind or a cognitive process. The problem becomes how to reconcile subjective experience with objective observation.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Self-Referentiality:</strong> The ""mind-mind problem"" acknowledges the self-referential nature of consciousness studies, where the act of observing a mind is itself a mental act. This leads to the recognition that the observer's mind inevitably influences the observations, requiring a ""second-order"" approach.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Epistemological Implications:</strong> The ""mind-mind problem"" highlights that the challenge is epistemological, not just ontological. It challenges traditional scientific methodologies that assume objectivity and separation between the observer and the observed.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Need for Self-Transformation:</strong> Both approaches suggest that understanding the mind requires a process of self-transformation on the part of the scientific observer. This involves acknowledging one's own biases, assumptions, and the influence of one's own experience on the way scientific problems are formulated and interpreted. This also means to accept the ""groundlessness"" of the pathway.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>The Limits of Traditional Science</strong>: The traditional scientific approach struggles to account for the subjective ""view from within"". The ""mind-mind"" problem shows that science needs to integrate the first person perspective into its epistemological framework to properly understand the nature of mind and consciousness.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Critique of Functionalism:</strong> The ""mind-mind"" problem challenges functionalist methodologies often used in cognitive science, which treat the mind as a kind of input-output system, neglecting the role of the observer and the subjective experience.</li>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Scybernethics as a Response:</strong> The Scybernethic approach, with its emphasis on the observer-actor, is a response to this ""mind-mind problem"". It is a ""second-order"" approach that integrates the ""view from nowhere"" (third person perspective) with the ""richness of lived experience"" (first person perspective).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Ambijective Gesture:</strong> Scybernethics uses the ""ambijective gesture"" as a way of acknowledging that any act of objectification also has a subjective dimension and vice versa. This is a lived first-person cycling gesture between first and third person perspectives to achieve a co-determination of knowledge.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Experimental Epistemology:</strong> Scybernethics also uses computer simulations as a way to explore the ""mind-mind problem"" and to understand the observer's role in shaping knowledge. By designing models of artificial cognition, Scybernethics tries to understand the interaction between the observer and the cognitive process.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Emphasis on Ethics:</strong> Scybernethics stresses that the ""mind-mind problem"" is not just an epistemological challenge but an ethical one. How we understand the mind has implications for how we relate to ourselves, each other, and technology.</li>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Summary</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, the shift from a mind-body problem to a mind-mind problem, as a result of the adoption of <strong>meta-dualist</strong> perspectives, recognizes the crucial role of the observer-actor in the scientific process. It calls for a radical rethinking of scientific methodology, emphasizing self-reflection, and the integration of subjective experience in the quest to understand the mind. Both Scybernethics and Varela's cybernetic dialectic contribute to this shift, albeit with different emphases and practical strategies. While Varela's approach emphasizes a change in the logical framework, Scybernethics also provides a practical methodology for transforming the scientist, and uses computer simulations as a tool for experimentation on the self.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scybernethics uses the concept of ""<strong>transduction</strong>"" to describe the apparent transformation of an epistemological descriptive formalization (form) into a dynamic process and vice versa, bridging gaps between seemingly disparate spacialized and temporal domains. This concept is key to understanding both the historical constitution of modern science and the emergence of the information age, and to avoid the confusions (like brain/mind or model/reality) resulting from a techno-scientific lack of rigorous analytical distinction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>N.B.: This concept should not be confused with the more technically polarized ""transduction"" of Gilbert Simondon witch entail an amplification (cf. the example of the crystal), where the scybernethics transduction entail an attentional displacement/jump called ""cut"" from an epistemological dimension to another.</em></p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Transduction and the Cartesian Cut</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Scybernethics identifies a ""quasi-double cut"" (<strong>formalized double cut</strong>) at the heart of the Cartesian worldview, which separates mind from body and subject from object. This Cartesian cut is viewed as a <strong>process/form transduction</strong> (from individual philosophy to collective science, from methodology to worldview). The individual, philosophical act of separating mind and body was formalized and reified into a dominant cultural norm, and led to the development and institutionalization of modern science.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>This Cartesian cut enabled the rise of a <strong>mechanistic view of the world</strong>, where the human mind was seen as separate from and able to objectively study the natural world.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>This perspective emphasized a <strong>""third person"" point of view</strong>, where the observer is considered separate from the observed, pushing the ""thinker-actor"" out of the domain of observation.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Scybernethics posits that this focus on objective, third-person observation has led to a neglect of the <strong>phenomenological ""processual knowing""</strong> or ""procedural knowledge"" that is an essential part of cognition, which is also referred to as the ""Explanatory gap"" (Levine 1983) or ""Hard problem of Consciousness"" (Chalmers 1994).</li>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Transduction and the Information Age</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Scybernethics also identifies a second ""double cut"" that occurred with the advent of the ""information age"" through the work of Shannon, Turing, and von Neumann.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>This ""double cut of the digital"" is a technical one: first, a <strong>cut to meaning, which is reduced</strong>, and second, a <strong>cut to matter, which is abstracted</strong> (Bachimont 2021).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The work of Claude Shannon, with Weaver collaboration, who developed an <em>mathematical theory of communication</em> (1948), <strong>abstracted</strong> communication from its semantic content and meaning making dimension, reifying ""communication"" as ""information"". This transformation represents another form/process transduction.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Alan Turing's concept of the Turing machine formalized the mechanical process of calculation and was materially implemented by John von Neumann who coupled it with the abstract Boolean binary logic, to produce a functional <strong>automatic computing machine</strong>. This can also be seen as a transduction of a mechanical gesture of calculation into an electronic process through binary logic.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>This series of transductions, coupled with a massive cultural common-sense <strong>metaphorization</strong> (memory, mouse, windows, clouds, learning, etc) has led to a ""techno-cultural collective abstraction"" and a ""consensual illusion"" of a ""virtual reality"" or ""cyberspace"".</li>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Introduction</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The notion that computers will one day “think” like humans has long been a driving force behind artificial intelligence research. However, in the realm of scybernethics, we propose a different, more human-centered approach: <strong>shifting our focus from computers that think to computers that make <em>us</em> think</strong>. This subtle yet profound change in perspective opens up new avenues for self-understanding, where technology becomes a mirror reflecting our own cognitive processes. This is where the concept of the <em>tekhnicus</em> and its sedimentation becomes central to scybernethic inquiry.</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">The ""Double Cut"" and the Technology-by-Itself Fallacy</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our journey begins by acknowledging a critical issue: the illusion that technology is neutral and separate from us. This ""technology-by-itself"" fallacy, as it's termed in scybernethics, obscures the fact that <strong>technology incorporate human intentions, biases, and ways of thinking</strong>. The historical development of computers involved what Bruno Bachimont called a ""double cut:"" a separation between meaning and matter. This cut, achieved through abstract programming layers, creates an illusion that computers are independently intelligent. But they are not, they are just complex dynamical machines that operate according to the logic of their design, and the logic of their designer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Tekhnicus: Mind as a Gesture</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To move beyond this illusion, we introduce the concept of the <em>tekhnicus</em>. Inspired by Bourdieu’s notion of “habitus,” the <em>tekhnicus</em> refers to the embodied, <strong>practical knowledge and skills we develop through our interactions with technology</strong>. It's about understanding technology not as a tool separate from ourselves but as a kind of extension of our cognitive and physical being. It's the internal feeling, the ""internal gesture"" that we develop when interacting with these complex systems. This is also closely related to the idea that ""mind is a gesture"", which also speaks to the enactive and sensorimotor understanding of embodied cognition (cf. Piaget, Noë, Di Paolo).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Sedimentation: The Shaping of Our Cognitive Processes</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <em>tekhnicus</em> is not static; it's a dynamic process shaped through repeated interaction and what we call <em>sedimentation</em>. This means that our habitual use of technology leaves a kind of trace in our ways of thinking, perceiving, and acting. Just as our past experiences sediment in our bodies, our repeated interactions with technologies sediment into our cognitive ""habits"". This sedimentation subtly alters our internal dynamics, making certain ways of thinking more natural, more fluent, and often implicit and tacit. This is why it's important to develop an awareness of the way that we interact with technology, and how technology interacts with us.</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Experiential Epistemology: Computers as Mirrors</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":48828,""sizeSlug"":""large"",""linkDestination"":""media""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><a href=""https://scybernethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Experimental-Experiential_Epistemology_1200.png""><img src=""https://scybernethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Experimental-Experiential_Epistemology_1200-1024x863.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-48828""/></a></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead of viewing computers solely as tools for computation, scybernethics encourages us to consider them as <strong>experiential and experimental tools</strong> (cf. McCulloch) for self-understanding. By designing and interacting with computer simulations, particularly of a-cognition and complex systems, we can gain a unique ""feeling"" for the underlying processes. We create computational models not to replicate human intelligence, but to explore and objectify our own cognitive dynamics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is where PDP and ANN (Parallel Distributed Processing, Artificial Neural Networks) models become particularly insightful. These models operate in a way that seems to mirrors and mimic our own neural processes but moreover they are more deeply a way of thinking distributed processes, where multiple interconnected units interact to produce emergent behaviors. By working with these models, we develop a practical phenomenological understanding of complex dynamics, which resonates with our lived experience, enabling the <em>tekhnicus</em> to evolve.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Reflective Cycle: From Process to Form</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This understanding is not just theoretical but deeply <em>experiential</em>, involving a “techno-phenomenological” approach (see Don Ihde for e.g. or Stiegler techno-philosophy) that integrates first-person experience with third-person observation. This creates a hermeneutical cycle between the internal feeling (1P) and external representation (3P), between experience and observation, where a reflective loop is made possible through an iterative process. The iterative (vs generative) approach is necessary to tame the self-referential and recursive aspect of the methodology. The design and use of these models become a method of ""experimental and experiential epistemology,"" where the process of learning is also a process of self-discovery. By using computer simulation as a form of ""modeling clay"" for our own understanding, we enter an iterative cycle, leading to the stabilization of new cognitive schemes called ""<strong>techno-experiential schemes</strong>"" similar to stabilized affordances (Gibson).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Processual DimenTion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This cycle reveals the importance of the ""processual dimenTion,"" a term that highlights the dynamic and ever-changing nature of our cognitive processes. In contrast with the static ""formal"" dimension, the processual dimension emphasizes that our knowledge is always in flux. Our understanding is enacted, meaning it emerges from our interactions with the world, technologies included. The <em>tekhnicus</em> awareness, as a form of practical, embodied knowledge, allows us to navigate this dynamic interplay. This notion is also related to the idea that computers can make us think by ""revealing to us what is most mechanically automatic and unconscious in us"" (cf. Heidegger).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Conclusion: Toward a Second-Order Rationality</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In conclusion, the scybernethic approach proposes a shift from an anthropocentric (anthropo-functionalism) and view of computers as thinking machines to a human-centered view of computers as tools that can make us think by objectifying and reflecting our own cognitive processes. The <em>tekhnicus</em>, shaped by our interactions with technology, embodies this idea. By acknowledging the ""technology-by-itself"" fallacy and embracing an experiential epistemology, we can leverage technology to foster self-understanding and move towards a <strong>second-order rationality (rationality²)</strong> —a more reflexive, embodied, and ethical way of thinking. The sedimentation of the <em>tekhnicus</em> is not merely about acquiring skills; it’s about transforming our cognitive processes and actively participating in the ongoing construction of our own selves (self-design).</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By paying attention to the way we interact with technology, by understanding how we form a <em>tekhnicus</em>, we start to get a handle on the ""mechanical"" aspects of our cognition (cognitivist vs enactive epistemology). We can then leverage that understanding to create a more balanced and ethical relationship with our technology, and with ourselves.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Introduction</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an age dominated by artificial intelligence, technological mediation, and complex systems, Christophe Rigon's <strong>Scybernethics</strong> emerges as a groundbreaking framework that redefines how we understand cognition, memory, and the self. Rooted in second-order cybernetics and the enactive paradigm, Scybernethics offers a participatory, processual approach to knowledge-making, bridging phenomenology, technological hermeneutics, and experimental epistemology. This article delves into the key aspects of Scybernethics, its philosophical underpinnings, and its relevance in addressing contemporary challenges.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">What is Scybernethics?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scybernethics is a <strong>second-order rationality framework</strong> that integrates diverse fields—including phenomenology, cognitive sciences, and technological studies—to explore the dynamic interplay between humans and their environments. Unlike Wiener’s classical cybernetics, which focuses on control and feedback loops in systems, Scybernethics emphasizes the <strong>autonomy of the observer</strong> and their role in generating temporary meanings through embodied interaction with environmental constraints.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At its core, Scybernethics seeks to dissolve dualities such as mind/body or subject/object by situating cognition as an <strong>existential enaction</strong>—a process through which meaning emerges from lived experience rather than pre-existing structures. This approach critiques static ontologies and deterministic models of AI while advocating for a participatory relationship with technology.</p>

<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Memory as Processual and Distributed</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A cornerstone of Scybernethics is its conception of <strong>memory</strong> as a <strong>processual and distributed phenomenon</strong>. Memory is not confined to the brain but extends metaphorically across embodied practices, cultural artifacts, and technological tools. This aligns with the enactive paradigm, where cognition is seen as a dynamic process shaped by historical sedimentation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rigon critiques reductive metaphors like ""machine memory"" or ""AI learning,"" emphasizing that memory is not a static repository but an active process of stabilization and reactivation. Through this lens, technologies act as mediators in the iterative cycles of knowledge formation rather than literal extensions of human cognition.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Tekhnicus: Technology in Meaning-Making</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The concept of the <strong>tekhnicus</strong> lies at the heart of Scybernethics’ exploration of human-technology interaction. It refers to the dynamic integration of technology into human cognition as both a constraint and an enabler of meaning-making. The tekhnicus emphasizes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Embodied Interaction</strong>: Technologies mediate how humans perceive and act in the world.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Iterative Stabilization</strong>: Practices shaped by technological tools sediment over time into stable patterns while remaining open to reinterpretation.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This concept parallels Pierre Bourdieu’s <strong>habitus</strong>, which describes socially inculcated dispositions that guide behavior. However, while habitus focuses on social structures internalized within individuals, tekhnicus extends this idea to include technological mediation as a dynamic force shaping cognition.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Computer Simulations: Experimental and Experiential Epistemology</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Scybernethics, computer simulations of artificial cognition (AI) serve as tools for both <strong>experimental</strong> and <strong>experiential epistemology</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Experimental Epistemology</strong>: Simulations model distributed processing to study emergent behaviors objectively.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Experiential Epistemology</strong>: Researchers engage reflexively with these simulations to gain first-person insights into cognitive processes.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This dual approach aligns with phenomenological inquiry by bridging third-person scientific modeling with first-person lived experience. Simulations are thus hermeneutic tools for exploring cognition rather than literal representations of intelligence or selfhood.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Resonances: Bourdieu, Merleau-Ponty and Don Ihde </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scybernethics resonates heavily with phenomenological but also sociological traditions:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Like <strong>Bourdieu's habitus</strong> (its inspiration), the scybernethics ""tekhnicus"" refers to a system of dispositions that shape how individuals interact with their environment, but while habitus emphasizes socially ingrained habits and perceptions, tekhnicus focuses on the dynamic interplay between humans and technological mediation in generating situated meanings and practices. </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Like <strong>Maurice Merleau-Ponty</strong>, it share an emphasis on <strong>embodiment</strong> and the dynamic process of <strong>sedimentation</strong>, where past experiences shape present actions. The tekhnicus sedimentation describes a process of accumulating experiences and knowledge that shape our understanding and behavior, but while Merleau-Ponty's concept focuses on the embodied consciousness and its historicity, tekhnicus sedimentation emphasizes the dynamic interplay between humans and technological mediation in forming layers of meaning and practices. Both concepts highlight how past experiences become embedded in our current perceptions and actions, but tekhnicus sedimentation specifically considers the role of technology in this process, reflecting the evolving relationship between humans and their technological environment.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Like <strong>Don Ihde’s postphenomenology</strong>, it integrates a focus on <strong>technological mediation</strong>, examining how tools amplify or constrain human capabilities. But while Ihde's approach emphasizes the relations between humans and technological artifacts in shaping our experiences and perceptions of the world, scybernethics extends this concept by incorporating the dynamic interplay between humans, technology, and meaning-making processes in a more reflexive and processual framework. Both approaches reject Cartesian dualism as the only explanatory principle and explore embodied interactions with technology, but scybernethics places greater emphasis on the autonomous generation of temporary, situated meanings through these interactions.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These conceptions converge in Scybernethics’ critique of pure deterministic models (complexity principle) while emphasizing the participatory nature of meaning-making through embodied interaction with technology.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scybernethics offers critical insights into pressing issues such as:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The overuse of metaphors like ""memory"" or ""intelligence"" in AI discourse, which risks alienating humans from their lived experiences.</li>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Christophe Rigon’s Scybernethics represents a paradigm shift in how we think about cognition, memory, and technology. By integrating phenomenology, second-order cybernetics, and experimental epistemology, it offers a nuanced framework for understanding the dynamic interplay between humans and their environments. In doing so, it challenges deterministic narratives about AI and technology while emphasizing the importance of embodied meaning-making.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rigon’s second-order rationality (<strong>rationality²</strong>) builds upon and critiques first-order approaches by integrating reflexivity, embodiment, and existential concerns. Its key features include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>a. Reflexivity and Self-Awareness</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Second-order rationality incorporates the observer into the cognitive process, acknowledging that the act of knowing is shaped by the knower. This aligns with von Foerster’s idea that “an observer is its own ultimate object”.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>It involves thinking about thinking, or “the concept of the concept,” while also considering the process of conceptualization itself and its embodied context.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>b. Meaning-Making Beyond Logic</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Unlike first-order rationality’s focus on formal logic and propositional reasoning, second-order rationality emphasizes <strong>meaning-making</strong> as a dynamic and situated process. It integrates creative cognition and intuition as essential components.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>c. Co-Determination</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Rationality² views cognition as a holistic interplay between multiple dimensions (e.g., top-down/bottom-up or explicit/implicit processes). This co-determination reflects an interconnected view of knowledge-making rather than a linear or reductionist one.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>d. Enactive and Processual Approach</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Inspired by enaction, second-order rationality sees cognition as arising from the organism’s dynamic interaction with its environment, including technological mediation. It highlights the processual nature of knowledge as a flux rather than static representations.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>e. Existential Dimension</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Second-order rationality incorporates existential concerns, exploring how rational processes relate to broader questions of being and existence. It emphasizes the ethical and participatory aspects of engaging with the world.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>f. Technological Hermeneutics</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>This approach integrates technology into its framework, recognizing how tools like AI mediate our understanding of reality. However, it critiques simplistic metaphors (e.g., AI as ""intelligence"") by focusing on how humans co-create meaning with these tools.</li>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Conclusion: A Paradigm Shift</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While first-order rationality focuses on objective reasoning detached from the observer’s context, Rigon’s second-order rationality also embraces reflexivity, embodiment, and existential engagement. It challenges traditional epistemologies by integrating creative cognition, technological mediation and hermeneutics, and meaning-making into a holistic and more comprehensive framework.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This shift underscores scybernethics’ broader aim: to cultivate a participatory understanding of cognition that bridges subjective experience with objective inquiry while fostering ethical engagement with our technological and social environments.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Introduction</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the evolving landscape of cognitive science, Christophe Rigon's concept of ""second-order rationality"" within the framework of scybernethics offers a fresh perspective on cognition and its relationship to the world. This article explores how Rigon's second-order rationality differs from traditional first-order rationality, while integrating the three key paradigms of cognitive science: cognitivism, connectionism, and enaction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Natural Attitude and First-Order Rationality</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First-order rationality, rooted in our phenomenological ""<em>natural attitude</em>,"" focuses on objective, propositional, and rule-based reasoning. This natural attitude, as described by Husserl, begins with beliefs supposedly corresponding to things in nature and works toward a theory inclusive of the activity of the animal who has those beliefs. It emphasizes logical coherence and formal systems, often reducing cognition to mechanistic processes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Cognitivism and Connectionism</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cognitivism views the mind as an <em>information processing system</em>, similar to a computer<a href=""https://cepa.info/paper.cgi?id=2074&amp;action=add"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">1</a>. It focuses on producing models of the mind, seeing abstraction as constituting what mind or cognition is. This approach emphasizes explicit and symbolic representations that denote external objects, assuming an absolute and accessible ontology.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Connectionism models mental phenomena as <em>emergent processes</em> of interconnected networks of simple units. It emphasizes the brain as the main source of metaphors and ideas, starting with neural-like, simple components that, when appropriately connected, exhibit interesting global properties. Connectionism relies on gradual changes in connections between these components to embody cognitive capacities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Transcending the Natural Attitude: Second-Order Rationality and Enaction</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rigon's second-order rationality, as part of the scybernethics framework, incorporates reflexivity, embodiment, and existential concerns. It aligns closely with the enactive paradigm, which argues that cognition arises through dynamic interaction between an acting organism and its environment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second-order rationality recognizes the <em>observer's role</em> in the cognitive process, acknowledging that the act of knowing is also shaped by the knower. This aligns with the idea that ""an observer is its own ultimate object,"" (von Foerster, second-order cybernetics) emphasizing the importance of self-awareness in the process of reasoning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Key Aspects of Second-Order Rationality in Scybernethics</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Regulatory and homeostatic</strong>: It acts as a regulatory mechanism maintaining balance in cognitive processes.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Meaning-making</strong>: It emphasizes the creation and interpretation of meaning, moving beyond mere logical processing.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Co-determination</strong>: It involves simultaneous co-determination of different aspects of cognition.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Creative cognition</strong>: It incorporates aspects of creative thinking and intuition.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Technological hermeneutics</strong>: It considers the role of technology in shaping our understanding of the world.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Existential dimension</strong>: It includes an existential component, considering how rational processes relate to broader questions of being.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Self-reflexivity</strong>: It involves a level of self-awareness in rational processes.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Integrating and Transcending Perspectives</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While first-order rationality and its associated paradigms (cognitivism and connectionism) operate within the natural attitude, second-order rationality in scybernethics integrates and transcends these perspectives (Meta-Dualism). It acknowledges the value of objective knowledge and technological tools while recognizing their limitations and situating them within a broader, more reflexive framework.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This integration is evident in scybernethics' approach, which combines ""iterative historical stabilizations of scientific cultural formalizations and methodologies, phenomenological inquiry and computer simulation hermeneutics"". It recognizes the importance of both first-person enactive research and second-order cybernetics, bridging subjective experience with objective inquiry in a <em>1P-3P epistemological approach</em> combining both, without dissolving them. It leads to a new phenomenological and cognitive domain of knowledge similar to the technologically-induced ""cyberspace"", but induced this time by cognitive epistemology (scyberspace?!).</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Christophe Rigon's concept of second-order rationality within the scybernethics framework offers a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of human cognitive processes. By integrating aspects of embodiment, creativity, technology, and existential concerns, it provides a more holistic view of rationality that transcends the natural attitude.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we navigate the challenges of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the emerging era of generative artificial intelligence, this expanded understanding of rationality (rationality²) becomes increasingly crucial. It encourages us to consider not just how we process information, but <em>how we create meaning, interact with our environment, and understand our place in the world</em>. In doing so, it offers a path towards a more ethical and participatory approach to knowledge and technology, one that recognizes the full complexity of human cognition and experience.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Introduction</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this article, we explore the concept of <strong>scyberspace</strong>, a novel representational framework that integrates first-person and third-person epistemologies to study cognition, meaning-making, and recursive dynamics. Drawing inspiration from diverse fields such as geometry, topology, enactivism, and computational paradigms, scyberspace offers a powerful tool for bridging classical and modern approaches to understanding cognition. Along the way, we connect this idea to existing mathematical frameworks, the techno-socially induced ""cyberspace"", and Christophe Rigon’s <strong>Scybernethics</strong> paradigm.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Foundations: Geometry, Topology, and Noether's Theorem</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To understand scyberspace, we begin with its mathematical roots in <strong>geometry</strong> and <strong>topology</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Geometry</strong> focuses on measurable properties like distances, angles, and curvature. It provides the tools for understanding local structures.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Topology</strong>, on the other hand, studies global properties that remain invariant under continuous deformations (e.g., connectivity or compactness). It emphasizes relational and structural aspects.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These fields intersect in areas like <strong>geometric topology</strong>, where local geometric properties relate to global topological invariants. A key example is <strong>Noether's theorem</strong>, which links symmetries (invariances through transformation) in physical systems to conserved quantities. This theorem bridges geometry (symmetries) and topology (invariants), providing a framework for understanding how systemic patterns emerge. It is an important tool for understanding general relativity and has also <a href=""https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-noethers-theorem-revolutionized-physics-20250207/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">shaped the quantum conception in physics</a>.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Eigenbehavior: Self-Referential Dynamics</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Von Foerster’s concept of <strong>eigenbehavior</strong> introduces the idea of stable patterns (or eigenforms) emerging from recursive interactions between an observer and their environment. This aligns with both geometry (stable invariants) and topology (self-referential loops). Eigenbehavior emphasizes that meaning arises from the dynamics of interaction rather than being pre-given—a perspective that resonates with modern constructivist epistemologies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Umwelt and Affordances: Relational Worlds</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ideas of <strong>Uexküll’s Umwelt</strong> and <strong>Gibson’s affordances</strong> further enrich this conception:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Uexküll’s Umwelt describes an organism’s subjective world, shaped by its sensory-motor system. It highlights how each organism enacts its own reality through interaction.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Gibson’s affordances focus on actionable possibilities in the environment relative to an organism’s capabilities. These are relational properties that emerge through perception-action coupling.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both concepts emphasize the dynamic interplay between an organism and its environment, aligning with von Foerster’s eigenbehavior.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Scyberspace: A Quasi-Bidimensional Representation</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Building on these foundations, we propose <strong>scyberspace</strong>, a quasi-bidimensional space (cf. Varela's ""Not one, not two"") designed to model cognition. This framework integrates:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>A Cartesian Dimension</strong>: Representing measurable, objective states (e.g., external structures or physical properties).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>A Recursive-Imaginary Fractal Dimension</strong>: Representing dynamic, self-referential processes (e.g., qualia, subjective interpretation or emergent patterns). The use of imaginary numbers (i) reflects oscillatory or relational dynamics central to recursive systems.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This hybrid space (bidimenTion) allows us to model both first-person (subjective) and third-person (objective) perspectives simultaneously. For example:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>A point in scyberspace (x + yi) could represent an external event (x, Cartesian) coupled with its recursive interpretation (yi, imaginary).</li>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Scyberspace Across Cognitive Paradigms</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scyberspace provides a versatile framework for studying cognition across three major paradigms:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Cognitivism</strong>: <!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Cognitivism focuses on rules, symbols, and representations as the basis of cognition. </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The Cartesian dimension aligns with symbolic processing, while the recursive-imaginary dimension captures meta-representations or iterative adjustments.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list --></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Connectionism</strong>: <!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Connectionism emphasizes distributed processing in neural networks.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The recursive-imaginary dimension models emergent dynamics in networks, while the Cartesian dimension represents measurable outputs or physical instantiations.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list --></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Enactivism</strong>:<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Enactivism views cognition as embodied and arising through interaction with the environment.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The recursive-imaginary dimension captures self-referential dynamics central to enaction, while the Cartesian dimension represents environmental constraints or measurable interactions.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list --></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scyberspace thus bridges these paradigms by accommodating both discrete-symbolic (cognitivist), distributed-emergent (connectionist), and embodied-dynamic (enactive) perspectives.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Scyberspace and Scybernethics</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Christophe Rigon’s <strong>Scybernethics</strong> paradigm shares deep conceptual ties with scyberspace:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Second-Order Rationality</strong>:<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Scybernethics emphasizes second-order rationality—reflecting on the observer's role in knowledge-making. This aligns with scyberspace’s recursive-imaginary dimension, which models self-referential processes.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list --></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Quasi-Bidimensional Thinking</strong>:<!-- wp:list -->

<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Enaction and Embodiment</strong>:<!-- wp:list -->

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Conclusion: Toward a New Frontier in Cognitive Science</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scyberspace represents an innovative synthesis of ideas from geometry, topology, enactivism, computational theory, and ethics. Its quasi-bidimensional structure allows us to model cognition as both measurable (Cartesian) and emergent/recursive (imaginary), bridging classical cognitivist approaches with connectionist and enactive paradigms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By integrating first-person/third-person epistemologies into a unified framework, scyberspace offers a powerful tool for exploring cognition's multifaceted nature—whether through symbolic reasoning, neural network dynamics, or embodied interactions. Furthermore, its connection to Christophe Rigon's Scybernethics paradigm highlights its potential as a conceptual space for addressing ethical questions about human-machine systems in an increasingly interconnected world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we continue to develop this framework mathematically and apply it across disciplines, <em>scyberspace</em> may become a cornerstone for studying not only cognition but also the broader dynamics of meaning-making in complex systems.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Introduction</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The relationship between <strong>Scybernethics de-construction</strong>, <strong>Derrida's deconstruction</strong>, and <strong>Stiegler's techno-philosophy</strong> can be understood as a profound interplay of critical thought, recursive logic, and the exploration of conceptual dipoles. Scybernethics, with its emphasis on second-order rationality (logic²), resonates strongly with Derrida’s deconstruction of binary oppositions and Stiegler’s rethinking of technics as constitutive of human existence. Below, we explore these connections.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Derrida’s Deconstruction and Conceptual Dipoles in Scybernethics</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Derrida’s deconstruction critically examines binary oppositions (e.g., presence/absence, speech/writing) that underpin Western metaphysics. He reveals how one term is privileged over the other and seeks to destabilize this hierarchy by showing how each term depends on the other for meaning. This process is not about reversing the hierarchy but exposing the <strong>difference and deferral</strong> (différance) that constitute meaning itself. In Scybernethics, this approach is mirrored in its use of <strong>conceptual dipoles</strong>—pairs of interdependent concepts (e.g., subject/object, mind/body)—and the observation of their phenomenological <strong>asymmetry</strong> (one polarity is easier to grasp, to formalize and so to understand than the other) to explore the tensions and co-determinations within cognitive and epistemological systems. However, Scybernethics goes beyond deconstruction by introducing <strong>second-order logic (logic²)</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Logic² involves not only analyzing the relationship between concepts but also recursively reflecting on the process of conceptualization itsel.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>For example, a conceptual dipole like ""observer/observed"" is examined not only in terms of its binary structure but also through the recursive act of observing the observer—a hallmark of second-order cybernetics.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This recursive approach aligns with Derrida’s anti-foundationalism while extending it into a systematic framework for exploring dynamic processes and embodied cognition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Stiegler’s Techno-Philosophy and Scybernethics’ Recursive Rationality</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stiegler builds on Derrida’s concept of différance to argue that technology (technics) is not external to humanity but constitutive of it. He describes human beings as ""prosthetic"" creatures whose existence is always mediated by tools, memory systems, and exterior supports. For Stiegler:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Technology introduces an aporia: it both enables human development (as a prosthesis) and risks alienation or loss of autonomy (e.g., through cognitive capitalism). It is the ""pharmakologic"" (greek <em>pharmakon</em>, cf Plato, Stengers) ambiguous logic of technics because technics is <em>transjective</em>: it blurs the 1P-3P distinction through its processual nature.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>He emphasizes the need for a ""politics of memory"" (cf. <em>hypomnemata</em> and self-writing, Foucault) to ethically navigate this tension.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scybernethics converged with Stiegler’s insights by addressing how technology shapes cognition and culture:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>It critiques the ""mechanical rhythm"" of thinking reinforced by technological systems (e.g., AI metaphors like ""memory"" or ""learning"").</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Through its quasi-bidimensional logic (Cartesian-measurable vs. recursive-imaginary), Scybernethics models how humans interact with technics while maintaining ethical self-awareness.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>It use self-writing tools, hypomnemata (like top-down normative crossing bottom-up creative conceptual maping) in its methodology.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Like Stiegler, it emphasizes attentional practices (cf. the <em>ambijective gesture</em>) to counteract cognitive exploitation in techno-social systems.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where Stiegler focuses on technics as an externalized memory system, Scybernethics integrates this with second-order rationality to explore how individuals recursively enact meaning within these systems. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here <strong>memory</strong> is centered on the cognitive organism and conceived as a situated biocognitive <em>parallel and distributed process</em> (hermeneutic and heuristic) enacting a posteriori a formal remembrance. Memory is an embodied process (cf. Fuchs) or to put it in another way, our body is a (ontogenic, phylogenic and epigenetic) memory. So seeing technological artifacts as ""external memories"" (or extended cognition/mind, cf. Clark &amp; Chalmers EMT thesis) is understood here as heuristically useful but clearly metaphorical (a light way of speaking). I consider them as constraining/enabling factors of cognition and mind, not as ""extensions"" in a strict analytical sense, or the all universe should be considered as such.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, this typical technical transjective simplification, in phase with a reductionist and materialist understanding of empiricism, leads to a blurring between the organic and the non-organic, a vital distinction to preserve the discrimination between heuristical intentions and truth-telling (aletheia, cf. Foucault) in discourse regimes. The map is not the territory, the brain not the mind, and the model is not (conventional) reality, nor machines ""intelligent""! The meta-stabilized interaction between us and the artifact, appearing to us (phenomenological ""natural attitude"") as an enacted form, is erroneously taken as a property of the thing-in-itself (cf. Kant noumena/phenomena or cognitivism) leading to what I called the <em>technology-by-itself fallacy</em>. While metaphorical discourse is of course a legitimate mode of expression, the problem arises when this nuance is not clearly stated in a regime of discourse claiming to be ""scientific"", and therefore ethically carrying the social normativity of collective (conventional) reality.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Second-Order Logic (Logic²): The Unifying Framework</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both Derrida’s deconstruction and Stiegler’s techno-philosophy find a natural synthesis in Scybernethics’ second-order logic:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Logic² involves <strong>double hermeneutical cycles</strong>, where concepts are not only analyzed but recursively reflected upon in relation to their observer or enactor (Varela &amp; al.).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>This mirrors Derrida’s différance (the deferral and relational nature of meaning) while operationalizing it through recursive cybernetic principles.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>For example, in exploring the dipole ""human/machine,"" logic² examines not only their interdependence but also how this relationship is enacted by humans embedded within technological systems.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">From Cyberspace to Scyberspace: Personalizing Technological Mediation</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scybernethics bridges <strong>cyberspace</strong> (the techno-social domain) with <strong>scyberspace</strong> (a psycho-phenomenological framework for recursive cognition):</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Cyberspace represents externalized networks of interaction, while scyberspace models how individuals internalize these interactions through recursive meaning-making.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>This connection reflects Derrida’s insight that meaning arises through relational deferral and Stiegler’s view that technics mediates human experience.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By applying second-order logic to conceptual dipoles like ""subject/object"" or ""human/machine,"" but also ""explaining/understanding"" (in which we are immersed right ""now""), Scybernethics personalizes technological mediation, emphasizing ethical self-awareness and disciplined subjective experience.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Ethical Implications: Toward a Politics of Attention</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both Derrida and Stiegler emphasize ethics as central to their projects:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Derrida critiques metaphysical hierarchies to reveal hidden assumptions that shape power dynamics.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Stiegler warns against cognitive capitalism's exploitation of attention and calls for a politics that prioritizes care over consumption<a href=""http://www.transformationsjournal.org/2009-issue-no-17-bernard-stiegler-and-the-question-of-technics/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">5</a>.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scybernethics extends these ethical concerns by proposing attentional self-techniques grounded in second-order rationality:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>It encourages individuals to reflect recursively on their role as observers-enactors within techno-social systems.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>This aligns with Derrida’s deconstruction by uncovering hidden epistemological hierarchies and with Stiegler’s focus on cultivating autonomy in a technological age.</li>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Conclusion: A Recursive Dialogue Between Deconstruction, Technics, and Rationality</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scybernethics can be interpreted retrospectively and rationalized as a <strong>dialogical synthesis</strong> of Derrida’s deconstruction and Stiegler’s techno-philosophy:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>It adopts Derrida’s critique of binary oppositions while operationalizing it through second-order logic.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>It integrates Stiegler’s insights on technics as constitutive of humanity into a recursive framework for understanding cognition.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>By exploring conceptual dipoles within a quasi-bidimensional scyberspace, it provides tools for navigating the interplay between subjective experience and technological mediation.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, Scybernethics offers an ethical paradigm for engaging with technology in ways that preserve human autonomy, foster attentional discipline, and reveal the hidden dynamics shaping our epistemologies. It transforms deconstruction into an active practice of second-order reflection—an onto-epistemological reverse engineering designed for an era defined by rapid technological change.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In our fast-paced world, we're constantly bombarded with information and decisions. How do we make sense of it all? In scybernethics, we explore this question by diving deep into the heart of what we call ""<strong>com-putation</strong>,"" a process that goes far beyond mere calculation. It’s an embodied, intuitive approach to meaning-making that involves engaging with <em>conceptual dipoles</em>, seeking an <em>aesthetic feeling</em> of harmony, and resonating with a <em>second-order logic</em> (Logic²).</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Conceptual Dipoles: Navigating Tensions</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the core of scybernethics ""com-putation"" lies the idea of <strong>conceptual dipoles</strong>: pairs of terms that seem to be in opposition or complementary to each other, like ""form/process"", ""inside/outside"", or ""logic/analogic"", and even ""explaining/understanding"" in which we are immersed right now. These dipoles represent fundamental tensions in our understanding of the world. A key feature of conceptual dipoles is their inherent <strong>asymmetry</strong>. One side often appears easier to define, grasp, or formalize, while the other remains elusive. For example, ""form"" is something we can point to, while ""process"" is dynamic, fluid, and harder to pin down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>The Natural Attitude and the Initial Grasp</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When we encounter a conceptual dipole, we tend to naturally gravitate towards the more easily formalized side. This is one aspect of what is called the phenomenological “<strong>natural attitude</strong>”: a common-sense tendency to begin thinking by “grasping” a form and considering the perceptive evidence of an objective ""world-out-there"". This biases us towards the more easily formalized side of the dipole and causes us to overlook the processual one. This tendency is further amplified and supported by the need to share commonly validated ""explanations"" inter-subjectively, as is generally the case in classical science.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">""Com-putation"": More Than Just Calculation</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The etymology of ""computation"" can be broken down as follows:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Derived from Latin <em>com</em>, meaning ""with"" or ""together.""</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>From Latin <em>putare</em>, which originally meant ""to prune"" but later evolved to mean ""to reckon,"" ""to think,"" or ""to calculate.""</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In scybernethics, ""com-putation"" is not about formal mathematical operations but instead about <strong>meaningful intuitions</strong>. It's a dynamic, embodied process of meaning-making. It can be seen as a ""situated meaning-making transformative operation"" that involves engaging with the tension between the poles of a conceptual dipole, before making a decision. It’s a way of evaluating the asymmetrical relationship between these two poles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This ""com-putation"" is a synchronic, simultaneous, and embodied evaluation which is deployed iteratively. It is lived <em>analytical differentiation</em> (differentiation has been a driving force in the evolution of both mathematical understanding and cognitive-like technologies) and is about ""<strong>weighing</strong>"" the two sides, much like holding two objects in your hands and feeling their differences, actively engaging the sensorimotor loop. It is an ""internalized gesture of weighing"" where an embodied feeling of difference emerges. It is thus a <em>bio-cognitive act</em> rather than a purely logical or intellectual one.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Crucial Suspension of Judgment</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A central part of this process is the <strong>suspension of judgment</strong>. Rather than rushing to a conclusion or forcing a synthesis, we temporarily set aside our initial inclination towards the easily graspable side of the dipole. This allows us to deeply feel the tension between the poles, creating a space for new understanding and meaning-making.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Intuition as Enactive Inner ""Touch""</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Intuition is not a sudden flash of insight. Rather, it's a cultivated enactive process, a result here of the dynamic interactions between the self, intersubjective knowledge, and computer simulations. It’s about an inner ""touch"" or <strong>enkinaesthesia</strong> (cf. Susan Stuart, Radman), a form of embodied awareness that emerges as we engage with a conceptual dipole.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Computer simulations, especially of <em>Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) and self-organizing/emergentist models</em> in general (CA, ANN, Swarms, etc), serve as technological metaphor to simulate and understand intuitive processes. These simulations are not used so much for building artificial intelligence, but rather for enhancing our own understanding by offering a phenomenological conception of the enactive gesture.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Aesthetic Feeling: Harmony and the Golden Ratio</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The goal of ""com-putation"" is not just to understand the poles of a conceptual dipole but to <em>feel</em> their dynamic relationship. When this relationship is in balance (fairness), we experience an aesthetic feeling of harmony. This feeling is a form of “biocognitive homeostasis”, which is akin to a sense of balance and proportionality related experientially to the golden ratio.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":49108,""sizeSlug"":""large"",""linkDestination"":""media""} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At first it may seems strange to a ""Cartesian"" mind to introduce such aesthetical conception, but it becomes more rational when we try to understand the <em>geometrical meaning</em> of this proportion of proportions (second-order <strong>proportion²</strong>). Science has an aesthetic dimension.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The golden ratio, or extreme and mean ratio (Euclid), is defined explicitly and in comprehension as “<em>the ratio between the small part and the big one is the same as the ratio between the big part and the </em>whole”. It’s a mathematical concept found in art and nature, which is often associated with beauty and balance. It is also the point of convergence of the Fibonacci sequence and related to the greek gnomon (a shape that, when added to a figure, produces a new figure similar to the original).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It illustrate clearly what I have called the <strong>quasi-bidimensionality</strong> of lived cognition, relating the ""quasi-double"" constraint between part/part and part/whole. This ratio is also related to the ""spiralic"" dynamics we can perceive in our recursive meaning-making cognitive and phenomenological trajectories (cf. <a href=""https://scybernethics.org/exploring-scyberspace-a-new-framework-for-cognition-mathematics-and-ethics/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">scyberspace</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Experimentally and intuitively, this seems to be the balance point towards which my explorations have brought me and which I have rationalized, I think pertinently, in this way. So in scybernethics, the golden ratio serves as a metaphor for the kind of proportionality we seek when dealing with conceptual dipoles, leading to the search for an <em>harmonic and fair point</em> (sweet spot) of the relation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is not only related to the notion of <strong>quasi-bidimensionality</strong> but also to <strong>second-order logic</strong> (logic²), where <em>a distinctions is understood as both a clear analytical segregation between two conceptions (like 1P vs 3P perspectives) but also as one encapsulating the other (emergence, levels of abstraction and hierarchical distinctions)</em>, leading to the integrated phenomenological concept of <strong>distinction²</strong>. It is the experiential root of scybernethics <strong>ana-logic</strong> (analogic and logic) conception of rationality (ratio-nality), which encompass and extend classical linear and explanatory ""reason"".</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Logic²: A Second-Order Resonance</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This feeling of balance, through enkinaesthesia, also resonates with scybernethics’ second-order logic (Logic²). <strong>Logic²</strong> is formalized as a second-order <em>ana-logic ratio</em> (ratio²), which emphasizes the combination of analogical and logical dimensions. The golden ratio and Logic² both represent a <em>relation of relations</em> (relation²), which is a way to understand the pconstraints between analytical parts of coherent whole.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On this schema, you can see the <em>hermeneutical and heuristical circulation</em> (formal co-determination) between both polarities (analytical vs hierarchical) of the second-order <strong>distinction²</strong>, integrating both the first-person (1P) phenomenological and the third-person (3P) classical Cartesianist science perspectives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This relates to the principle that <em>the initial epistemic act brings forth a distinction between subject and object</em>. Scybernethics includes the observer in the system being observed, which is also a second-order cybernetic principle. The ""not three, not four"" aspect of the golden ratio and the self-referential nature of second-order thinking make them deeply resonant with each other.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Conclusion: A Deeper Way of Knowing</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By understanding ""<strong>com-putation</strong>"" as an embodied, intuitive process, we move beyond purely intellectual calculations toward a more comprehensive and meaningful way of understanding. Scybernethics offers us a path to generate deeper insights through the suspension of judgment, seeking balance, and feeling the aesthetic harmony, thereby <em>transforming not only our understanding but also ourselves</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, ""Scybernethics"" itself and its key concepts are the post hoc formalized result of such an embodied and enacted distributed process, patiently developed and balanced iteratively over many disciplines and many years. Scybernethics is a <strong>regulatory paradigm</strong>.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the twilight of our technological era, we find ourselves at the precipice of a new understanding of humanity—one that challenges the very foundations of our self-conception. As we gaze into the abyss of our own creation, we are compelled to ask: What does it mean to be human in an age where the boundaries between the organic and the artificial blur with each passing moment?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The notion of the non-inhuman (Lyotard, Stiegler) emerges as a beacon in this existential fog, offering a path that is neither a retreat into nostalgic humanism nor a surrender to posthuman determinism. It is, rather, an invitation to engage in the perpetual act of becoming—a paradoxical state that acknowledges our technological entanglement while fiercely guarding the flame of our irreducible essence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To be non-inhuman is to inhabit a space of tension, forever poised on the knife-edge of existence. It is to recognize, as Valéry might say, that ""<em>the work is never finished, only abandoned</em>"". We are tasked with the Sisyphean labor of defining our own nature, not once, but continuously, in a dialogue that spans generations and transcends the boundaries of the self.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This dialogue unfolds not in the sterile language of first-order rationality, with its illusions of objectivity and detachment. Instead, it takes place in the rich, ambiguous terrain of what some might call ""non-inhumanism""—a mode of thought that embraces the autonomy of reason while recognizing the need for constant revision of what it means to be human.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The non-inhuman exists in a state of continuous becoming, recognizing the absurdity of existence—the chains of mortality that bind us all—but refusing to succumb to despair. Instead, it forges meaning through the very act of engagement with the world, in a process of co-creation that involves not just other humans but also the technologies that increasingly mediate our experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As Valéry reminds us, ""<em>A work is never completed except by some accident such as weariness, satisfaction, the need to deliver, or death: for, in relation to who or what is making it, it can only be one stage in a series of inner transformations</em>"". So too is our understanding of humanity never complete, always in flux, always demanding our attention and our labor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this light, the challenges posed by artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies become not threats to our humanity but mirrors in which we may glimpse new facets of our own nature. The act of creating these digital entities forces us to grapple with fundamental questions of consciousness, creativity, and ethics. In doing so, we engage in a form of existential calisthenics, strengthening our capacity for self-reflection and ethical reasoning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The path of the non-inhuman is not an easy one. It demands constant vigilance, a willingness to question our most cherished assumptions, and the courage to face the uncertainty that lies at the heart of existence. But it is in this very struggle that we find our most profound humanity—not as a static quality to be preserved, but as a dynamic process of growth and transformation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we stand on the threshold of an uncertain future, let us embrace the challenge of becoming non-inhuman. Let us engage in the great work of self-creation with the full force of our rational and intuitive faculties, weaving together reason and imagination in a tapestry of meaning that is uniquely our own. For it is only by fully embracing our role as co-creators of reality that we can hope to remain truly human in a world that increasingly threatens to render us obsolete.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, the question is not whether we can remain human in the face of technological change, but whether we have the courage to continually redefine what humanity means. This is the task that the concept of the non-inhuman sets before us—a task as daunting as it is exhilarating, as fraught with peril as it is rich with possibility. It is, in short, the very essence of what it means to be alive in this strange, beautiful, terrifying moment in the history of our species.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">A Historical Echo of Memory and Forgetting</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The concepts of <strong>memory and forgetting, or <em>anamnesis</em></strong>, have echoed through the corridors of human thought for millennia, inspiring philosophers, artists, and scientists alike. From <strong>Plato's theory of recollection</strong> to <strong>Nietzsche's concept of eternal recurrence</strong> or <strong>Bergson's concept of durée</strong>, the interplay between remembering and forgetting has been a central theme in our quest to understand ourselves and our place in the world. In the age of cognitive science and technology, this exploration has acquired new dimensions, with various paradigms offering distinct perspectives on memory, and how it is intertwined with its apparent opposite. This article will explore these perspectives, focusing on the evolution from traditional cognitivist views to the embodied enactive approach, and how the latter is coherently integrated into the scybernethics regulatory paradigm, including the crucial role of ""<em>hypomnemata</em>"".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Paradigms of Memory in Cognitive Science</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since its emergence in the mid-20th century, the field of cognitive science has been characterized by different approaches to understanding the mind, each with its own way of conceiving memory. Here, we will discuss how memory is conceived in each of the three main paradigms of the sciences and technologies of cognition: <strong>cognitivism</strong>, <strong>connectionism</strong>, and <strong>enaction</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">1. Cognitivism: Memory as Information Processing</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cognitivism, which dominated early cognitive science, views the mind as an information processor akin to a computer. In this framework, <strong>memory is seen as a system for encoding, storing, and retrieving information. </strong>Memories are treated as <strong>representations of the world stored in the brain</strong>, and recall is the process of accessing and retrieving these stored representations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Key Features</strong>:<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Representation</strong>: Memory is composed of mental representations of external reality.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Storage and Retrieval</strong>: The process of remembering involves retrieving stored information.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Linearity</strong>: Cognitivist approaches tend to emphasize linear processing of information.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Localization</strong>: Mental representations are often assumed to be localized in specific brain regions.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list --></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">2. Human memory has nothing to do with computer metaphorical ""memory""</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While computer ""memory"" is localized and accessed by it's location (tech. its ""address""), human memory is<strong> </strong>""<strong><em>content-addressable</em></strong>"", meaning that one can retrieve/remember it through a partial version of the content. This characteristic allows for flexible and robust recall of information, often reconstructing complete memories from fragments or cues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Key aspects of content-addressable memory in human cognition include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Pattern Completion</strong>: The ability to reconstruct full memories from partial or corrupted inputs.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Associative Recall</strong>: Stored information can be accessed by presenting related or incomplete versions of the memory.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Context Reinstatement</strong>: Recalling a memory can partially bring back the context present when the memory was formed<a href=""https://baeuml.app.uni-regensburg.de/paper/papers_open/RA22_NRP.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""></a>.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">3. Connectionism: Memory as a Network of Associations</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Connectionism emerged as an alternative to cognitivism, drawing inspiration from the structure and function of neural networks (McCulloch). In this view, memory is not about storing discrete representations but about <strong>strengthening connections between nodes in a network</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Key Features</strong>:<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Distributed Representation</strong>: Information is represented as patterns of activation across a network of interconnected nodes.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Associative Memory</strong>: Memory works through the strengthening of connections between associated concepts or experiences.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Parallel Processing</strong>: Information is processed in parallel across the network, allowing for more flexible and context-sensitive retrieval.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list --></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">4. The ""Natural Attitude""</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both cognitivism and connectionism, however, share a commonality: <strong>they reflect the phenomenological ""natural attitude""</strong> (Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, etc). That is, they operate primarily from a <em>third-person perspective</em>, often treating the mind as an objective entity separate from the observer. The observer's role and subjective experience tend to be backgrounded in favor of objective, quantifiable processes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Enactive Turn: Memory as Embodied Action</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The enactive approach represents a radical departure from these traditional views, <strong>emphasizing the embodied, embedded, and experiential nature of cognition</strong>. Enactivism posits that <em>cognition is not about representing the world internally but about skillful engagement with the world through action</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Key Features</strong>:<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Embodiment</strong>: Cognition is grounded in the body's sensorimotor interactions with the environment.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Action-Oriented</strong>: Memory is not a passive storage system but an active process of constructing meaning through action.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Situated</strong>: Cognitive processes are always situated in a specific context and shaped by the apparent agent's goals and intentions, which themselves could also be understood as the post hoc interpretation of inner homeostatic process of regulation and environmental feedbacks (cybernetics principle), leading to coherent rationalizations.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Emergent</strong>: Expressed memories are not pre-existing entities/things (form) but emerge dynamically from the ongoing interplay between the agent and the environment.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list --></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Enactive Conception of Memory</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, from an enactive perspective, memory is not about retrieving stored representations but about <strong>enacting skillful and adaptive behaviors in the present</strong>. <em>Memories are seen as the products of actions taken to account for them in a given situation</em>, emphasizing the agent's active role in constructing their memories.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Key Implications</strong>:<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Dynamic Construction</strong>: Memories are continuously revised based on the synergy between previous and present experiences.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Reusable Processes</strong>: Memory remembers <em>reusable processes</em> rather than recoverable content.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Sensorimotor Coupling</strong>: Emphasis is placed on the role of <em>sensorimotor couplings</em>, the body, and the generation of cognition through action.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Body Memory</strong>: Implicit, tacit and ""procedural"" (Tulvin) / <em>processual memory,</em> related to skills, habits, and dispositions acquired through bodily experiences, plays a central role.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>History of structural coupling</strong>: Cognition is understood as effective action, as <em>the history of structural coupling that enacts/bring forth a meaningful world</em> (Varela).</li>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Scybernethics: Integrating Enactive Memory into a Regulatory Paradigm</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Scybernethics</strong> integrates second-order cybernetics, embodied enaction, and critical reflection on technology to develop a comprehensive framework for personal and scholarly <em>transformation and deeper understanding</em>. It provides a way of regulating cycles of distinctions in a reflective way. Scybernethics considers itself a ""<strong>regulatory meta-paradigm</strong>"" (meta-dualism and meta-epistemology).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How does scybernethics integrate the enactive and distributed conceptions of memory?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Tekhnicus Sedimentation</strong>: Scybernethics introduces the concept of ""tekhnicus sedimentation,"" which aligns with the enactive understanding of memory by <em>emphasizing the embodied and action-oriented nature of cognition and memory</em>. The ""Tekhnicus"" is enacted through reverse cognitive engineering of gestural externalizations (like reasoning, computer coding or skillful activities) to re-embody and remember them.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Processual Knowledge</strong>: Scybernethics stresses <em>iterative processes</em>, echoing the enactive focus on reusable processes rather than recoverable content. Computer simulations are used to think iteratively about thinking processes, analogically with processual knowledge.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Experiential Epistemology</strong>: Scybernethics uses models and computer simulations as <em>experimental and experiential epistemological tools</em>. This involves linking knowledge of dynamical processes to one's own feeling of internal gestures, in an effort to cycle between questions of how one feels thinking in terms of enaction and distributed representation and schemes.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Conceptual Dipoles and Dialogical Thinking</strong>: Scybernethics utilizes <em>conceptual dipoles</em> (e.g., form/process, inside/outside) as analytical tools and emphasizes dialogical thinking. This approach aligns with the enactive view of memory as a dynamic interplay between the agent and the environment, where meaning is constructed through ongoing interaction and negotiation.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Ambijective Gesture</strong>: The ""<em>ambijective gesture</em>"" in scybernethics describes a cycling between culturally deployed objectification and phenomenological subjectification. This <em>cyclical process</em> mirrors the enactive emphasis on the continuous revision of memories based on the interplay between past and present experiences.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Parallel Distributed Processing</strong> (PDP): Scybernethics draws inspiration from <em>emergent and complex</em> PDP models (like ANN, CA, Swarms, etc) to understand how memory functions in a <em>parallel and distributed way</em>. These models simulate biological memories, which are not localized but distributed and evolve dynamically/temporally in an <em>analogical way</em>.</li>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the cognitivist view of memory as information processing to the enactive perspective of memory as embodied action and distributed processes, our understanding of memory has undergone a <em>significant transformation</em>. The scybernethics framework provides a way to integrate the enactive and parallel distributed processing conceptions of memory into a broader regulatory paradigm, <strong>emphasizing the embodied, processual, action-oriented, and distributed nature of cognition and memory</strong>. By recognizing the active role of the organism in constructing memories through sensorimotor interactions with the environment, by understanding the distributed nature of memory, and by using ""<em>hypomnemata</em>"" and the <em>heuristics of cognitive simulations</em> (techno-hermeneutics of AI) to enhance and extend our cognitive capabilities, we can gain a deeper appreciation of the dynamic and continuously evolving nature of this fundamental aspect of human experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through the lens of scybernethics, memory is not just a repository of the past, but a <strong>living, breathing process that shapes our present and guides our future</strong>. It is in this continuous cycle of action, reflection, embodiment, distribution, and externalization that we truly come to <strong>re-member ourselves</strong>.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Introduction</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Warren McCulloch</strong>'s seminal 1961 essay, ""<em>What is a Number, that a Man May Know It, and a Man that He May Know a Number?</em>"", laid the groundwork for what would later be recognized as <strong>second-order cybernetics</strong>[1]. This profound question continues to resonate within the fields of cognitive science, cybernetics, and philosophy of mind. In this article, we'll explore how <strong>the concept of number</strong> emerges from embodied cognition and how this perspective aligns with the principles of second-order cybernetics and scybernethics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Enactive Origins of Number: Processual Gestures</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From a scybernethics perspective, <strong>numbers are not abstract entities existing independently of human cognition</strong>. Instead, they are enacted through a historical and phenomenological process, originating from the fundamental gesture of designation or indication[1]. This enactive view posits that <em>our understanding of numbers is grounded in embodied experiences and sensorimotor activities</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Consider the etymology of ""<strong>calculus</strong>,"" which refers to small stones used for counting. This linguistic connection highlights how abstract mathematical concepts are rooted in concrete, physical actions. In ancient time (3400 BC), imagine Mesopotamian Sumerians merchants and geometers using pebbles to develop common references when sharing land or exchanging goods. They have most likely enacted calculation from <em>the recurrence of repeated gestures </em>of common designation or body measurement, like piles of goods of the same volume or steps/cubits for example, then symbolized and abstracted by small pebbles to transcend direct presence. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So abstract numbers are in this deep understanding the emerging result of an <strong>enkinaesthetic phenomenological sedimentations of gestures</strong> (i.e. habits metastabilized through homeostatic  sensorimotricity and social coordinations), and not things-by-themselves as our inner and natural <em>processual forgetting</em> seems to imply (cf. Plato's anamnesia). It exemplify how numerical cognition emerges very likely from practical, gestural and embodied interactions with the world.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Transduction and Double Cuts</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The development of numerical systems illustrates a key concept in scybernethics: <strong><a href=""https://scybernethics.org/scybernethics-transduction-unveiling-the-double-cuts-in-modern-science-and-the-digital-age/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">transduction</a></strong>. This process involves a process/form leap from sensorimotor gestures to abstract symbols used for intersubjective communication, agreement and coordination of action (cf. Maturana's ""languaging""). The invention of numbers represents a significant ""<strong>double cut</strong>"":</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>A separation between concrete experience and abstract representation</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>A division between individual cognition and collective agreement</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This transduction enabled the development of more sophisticated mathematical thinking and laid the foundation for scientific and technological advancements.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Second-Order Cybernetics and the Observer</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McCulloch's essay, though predating the formal articulation of second-order cybernetics, embodies its core principles[2]. Second-order cybernetics emphasizes the <strong>role of the observer in systems</strong>, recognizing that the act of observation influences the observed phenomenon[3]. This reflexive stance is crucial when considering how humans come to know numbers and how numbers shape human cognition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the context of numerical cognition, we must consider not only how humans understand numbers but also how the concept of number influences human thought and perception. This circular relationship exemplifies the <strong>self-referential nature of cognition</strong> that is central to second-order cybernetics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Cartesian Cut and Beyond</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Cartesian separation of mind and body, as well as subject and object, has profoundly influenced Western scientific thought, leading to the <strong>institutionalization of modern science</strong>. However, the enactive perspective on number <a href=""https://scybernethics.org/overcoming-dualism-meta-dualism-comparing-scybernethics-and-varelas-cybernetic-dialectic/"">challenges this dualism</a>, emphasizing the embodied and situated nature of mathematical cognition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we move beyond the Cartesian paradigm, we can appreciate how numerical concepts arise from the interplay between embodied experience, cultural practices, and abstract reasoning. This holistic view aligns with the goals of second-order cybernetics in <strong>transcending simplistic subject-object distinctions</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Technological Implications</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The development of computing machines represents another significant transduction in human history. Claude Shannon's <strong>abstraction of communication as information</strong>, separated from embodied meaning, and the work of Alan Turing and John von Neumann in <strong>abstracting computation from matter</strong>, mirror the earlier abstraction of number from physical counting[5].</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These technological developments highlight how our understanding of number and <a href=""https://scybernethics.org/the-art-of-com-putation-intuition-balance-and-second-order-logic/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">computation</a> continues to evolve, influencing and being influenced by our cognitive models and technological capabilities.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Conclusion: Towards a Reflexive Understanding</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McCulloch's question about numbers and the humans who know them invites us to <strong>adopt a reflexive stance towards cognition and knowledge</strong>. By recognizing the enacted, embodied nature of numerical concepts, we gain insight into both the <em>power and limitations of mathematical thinking</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The scybernethics perspective, with its emphasis on enaction and embodied cognition, offers a rich framework for understanding the circular relationship between numbers and human cognition. As we continue to explore this relationship, we may find new ways to bridge the gap between abstract mathematical concepts and lived experience (cf. t<a href=""https://scybernethics.org/exploring-scyberspace-a-new-framework-for-cognition-mathematics-and-ethics/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">he <strong>scyberspace</strong></a>), leading to more nuanced approaches in fields ranging from education to artificial intelligence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In embracing the principles of second-order cybernetics, we acknowledge that our understanding of numbers is <strong>not a discovery of pre-existing truths, but a creative act of cognition shaped by our biological, cultural, and technological contexts</strong>. This reflexive awareness opens new avenues for research and invites us to reconsider the fundamental nature of mathematical knowledge and human understanding.</p>

<p>This comparison highlights the fundamental differences between the cognitivist approach of Kahneman's dual processing theory and the enactive paradigm of Rigon's scybernethics. While Kahneman's theory separates cognitive processes into two distinct systems, scybernethics seeks go further and integrate various aspects of cognition into a more holistic framework <a href=""https://scybernethics.org/scybernethics-summary-rationality-second-order-enaction-cybernetics/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">2</a>.

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Abstract</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This article presents a comparative analysis of four prominent approaches to understanding <strong>biocognition from an enactive perspective</strong>: the Free Energy Principle/Predictive Processing (FEP/PP) model, neurophenomenology, micro-phenomenology, and scybernethics. Each framework offers unique insights into the nature of cognition, consciousness, and the relationship between subjective experience and <a href=""https://scybernethics.org/a-number-that-a-man-may-know-and-a-man-that-may-know-a-number/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">objective measurement</a>. By examining their methodologies, theoretical underpinnings, and potential synergies, this article aims to provide a comprehensive but not exhaustive overview of the current landscape of enactive biocognitive science and to outline pathways toward a more integrated, onto-epistemologically grounded, and technologically informed understanding of life and mind.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Introduction</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The enactive approach to cognitive sciences and technologies marks <a href=""https://scybernethics.org/whence-perceptual-meaning-a-cartography-of-current-ideas-varela-f-j-1992/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">a shift from traditional cognitivist models</a> based on a <a href=""https://scybernethics.org/scybernethics-and-second-order-rationality-transcending-the-natural-attitude/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">naive phenomenological ""natural attitude""</a> (Husserl) toward an <strong>embodied, embedded, and relational nature of cognition</strong>. This perspective highlights the role of dynamic interactions between an organism and its environment in shaping cognitive processes. Within this broader framework, several methodologies have emerged, each offering distinct tools and perspectives for investigating the complexities of biocognition. This article focuses on four such approaches:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>The Free Energy Principle/Predictive Processing (FEP/PP)</strong>: Aims to provide a unified account of brain function in terms of hierarchical predictive models and error minimization.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Neurophenomenology</strong>: Seeks to bridge the gap between first-person subjective experience and third-person neurophysiological data.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Micro-phenomenology</strong>: Employs detailed first-person interviews to explore the micro-dynamics of lived experience and make explicit the implicit structures of consciousness.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Scybernethics</strong>: Integrates first-person and third-person epistemologies, emphasizing the role of technology and self-transformation in understanding cognition.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By comparing and contrasting these approaches, we aim to identify potential synergies and outline directions for future research that leverage the strengths of each framework to advance our understanding of enactive biocognition.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>The Free Energy Principle/Predictive Processing (FEP/PP) Model</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The FEP/PP model posits that the brain operates as a hierarchical inference machine, constantly predicting sensory inputs and minimizing prediction errors. Key tenets of this approach include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Hierarchical Generative Models</strong>: The brain constructs internal models to predict sensory inputs.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Prediction Error Minimization</strong>: Cognitive processes aim to reduce the discrepancy between predicted and actual sensory information.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Active Inference</strong>: Actions are performed to change the environment and fulfill predictions, thereby minimizing prediction error.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While FEP/PP offers a powerful framework for understanding the computational mechanisms underlying cognition, it has been criticized for its <em>potential neglect of embodiment and situatedness</em>.</p>

<li><strong>Simultaneous Collection of Subjective and Objective Data</strong>: Participants provide detailed descriptions of their experience while undergoing neuroimaging or electrophysiological recording.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Search for Neural Correlates of Consciousness</strong>: The goal is to identify neural patterns that correlate with specific aspects of subjective experience.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Emphasis on Replicability and Generalizability</strong>: Neurophenomenological studies aim to establish <em>reliable and consistent relationships between neural activity and subjective reports</em>.</li>

<li><strong>Explicitation Interviews</strong>: Participants are guided to access and describe the fine-grained details of their experience, often focusing on specific events or situations.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Emphasis on Implicit Aspects of Awareness</strong>: Micro-phenomenological interviews aim to uncover aspects of experience that are typically pre-reflective or outside of conscious awareness.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Use of Specific Probes and Techniques</strong>: Interviewers employ targeted questions and techniques to elicit detailed descriptions of sensory, emotional, and cognitive processes.</li>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The enactive paradigm of cognition represents a significant shift in our understanding of how organisms interact with and make sense of their world. This blog post explores the key epistemological characteristics of enactivism and introduces scybernethics as a valuable extension of this framework, highlighting the methodological consequences that point towards a scientific revolution based on second-order rationality.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Epistemological Characteristics of the Enactive Paradigm</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The enactive approach to cognition, pioneered by Francisco Varela, Evan Thompson, and Eleanor Rosch, posits that cognition arises through a dynamic interaction between an acting organism and its environment. Key epistemological characteristics include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Embodiment</strong>: Cognition is grounded in the body's sensorimotor interactions with the environment.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Autonomy</strong>: Organisms maintain their identity while dynamically engaging with their surroundings.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Emergence</strong>: Cognitive processes emerge from the ongoing interplay between agent and environment.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Sense-making</strong>: Organisms actively generate meaning through their interactions, rather than passively receiving information.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Groundlessness</strong>: There is no pre-given world or pre-given subject; both co-emerge through interaction.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This approach challenges traditional notions of cognition as mere information processing or internal representation of a pre-given world. Instead, enactivism proposes that organisms actively bring forth or ""enact"" their world of significance through embodied action<a target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enactivism"">7</a>.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Scybernethics: Extending the Enactive Framework</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scybernethics, developed by Christophe Rigon, offers a valuable extension of the enactive paradigm by integrating second-order cybernetics, embodied enaction, and critical reflection on technology. Key contributions include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Regulatory meta-paradigm</strong>: Scybernethics provides a way to regulate cycles of distinctions in a reflective manner.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Tekhnicus sedimentation</strong>: This concept aligns with the enactive understanding of memory by emphasizing the embodied and action-oriented nature of cognition.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Experiential epistemology</strong>: Scybernethics uses models and computer simulations as experimental tools to link knowledge of dynamical processes to one's own feeling of internal gestures.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Ambijective gesture</strong>: This describes a cycling between culturally deployed objectification and phenomenological subjectification.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Integration of parallel distributed processing</strong>: Scybernethics draws inspiration from emergent and complex models to understand how memory functions in a parallel and distributed way <a href=""https://scybernethics.org/re-membering-and-un-forgetting-memory-anamnesia-and-the-sciences-of-cognition/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">2</a>.</li>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The integration of enactivism and scybernethics points towards a scientific revolution based on second-order rationality. This new approach has several methodological consequences:</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The enactive paradigm, extended by scybernethics, offers a rich framework for understanding cognition that challenges traditional epistemological assumptions. By emphasizing <em>embodied action, co-emergence, and sense-making</em>, this approach invites us to reconsider our fundamental assumptions about mind, body, and world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The methodological consequences of this integration point towards a scientific revolution based on <a href=""https://scybernethics.org/comparing-first-and-second-order-rationality/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>second-order rationality</strong></a> (rationality²). This new approach promises to provide <em>more nuanced, reflexive, and contextually sensitive ways</em> of understanding cognition and human experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we continue to explore and apply these ideas, we may find ourselves better equipped to navigate the complex, dynamic, and deeply interconnected nature of cognition and experience in the 21st century. The challenge now lies in translating these theoretical insights into practical research methodologies and applications across various fields of study.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This short article synthesizes a philosophical and scientific dialogue bridging phenomenology, ecological psychology, enactive cognitive science, and formal neural modeling with key conceptual articulations. We examine how Merleau-Ponty’s concept of <em>motor intentionality</em>—the pre-reflective, embodied orientation of the subject toward the world—reconfigures the movement/consciousness relation, aligns with Gibson’s affordance theory, and finds computational resonance in the distributed, anticipatory dynamics of artificial neural networks. We conclude by situating this synthesis within the enactive paradigm (Varela et al.), highlighting the emergence of meaning and cognition through embodied, sensorimotor engagement with the world.<br></p>

<p>The classical divide between mind and body, perception and action, has been profoundly challenged by phenomenology, ecological psychology, and enactive cognitive science. This article retraces a conceptual trajectory from Husserl’s noesis, through Merleau-Ponty’s motor intentionality, to Gibson’s affordances and the enactive paradigm, culminating in a dialogue with contemporary neural modeling. The central thesis is that <em>movement is not mere reaction or mechanical execution, but the generative locus of sense-making and anticipation</em>.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Phenomenological Foundations: Noesis and Motor Intentionality</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Husserl’s phenomenology posits <em>noesis</em> as the subjective pole of intentionality—every act of consciousness is directed toward something (the noema). Merleau-Ponty radicalizes this by grounding intentionality in the <em>living body</em> (<em>Leib</em>), introducing <em>motor intentionality</em>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Movement is not commanded by a detached will, but arises from the body’s pre-reflective, skillful orientation toward the world.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The <em>body schema</em> is a dynamic, anticipatory structure enabling meaningful engagement without explicit representation.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This view dissolves the dualism of subject/object and representation/action, positing a <em>corporeal genesis of sense</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Affordances and the Ecology of Perception</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gibson’s <em>affordances</em>—the actionable possibilities offered by the environment—resonate with Merleau-Ponty’s insight. Affordances are neither purely objective nor subjective; they are relational, enacted through the organism’s sensorimotor capacities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The act of perceiving an affordance is itself an embodied anticipation of possible movement.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Attention and action are intertwined: what is perceived as possible is shaped by the body’s history and abilities.</li>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Parallel Distributed Modeling: Distributed Adjustment and Emergent Anticipation</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Artificial neural networks (ANNs) provide a formal analogy:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Learning is realized through <em>iterative micro-adjustments</em> of distributed weights, paralleling the body’s iterative sensorimotor adaptation.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Anticipation in ANNs is not programmed top-down, but <em>emerges</em> from the history of interactions—mirroring the <em>teleological</em>, generative aspect of motor intentionality.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The “goal-directedness” of the network is an <em>a posteriori</em> interpretation of its inner emergent, distributed and iterative (not generative) <em>quasi-analogical</em> dynamics.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This computational perspective supports the phenomenological claim that meaning and anticipation are not centralized, but arise from the system’s history and structure.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Enactive Paradigm: Cognition as Embodied Sense-Making</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <em>enactive</em> paradigm (Varela, Thompson, Rosch) synthesizes and extends these insights:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Cognition is <em>not</em> the manipulation of internal representations but the <em>enactment</em> of meaning through sensorimotor coupling with the environment.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Organism and world are co-determined in a history of structural coupling; perception and action are inseparable.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The body is not a passive medium, but the <em>locus of emergence</em> for sense, anticipation, and rationality.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Conclusion: Toward a Computational Phenomenology of Embodied Cognition</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The convergence of phenomenology, ecological psychology, enaction, and neural modeling yields a powerful thesis:<br><strong>Movement is not mere reaction or simple adaptation, but the creative, embodied genesis of meaning; a dynamic, distributed process where body, world, and consciousness co-emerge.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This synthesis invites a new science of consciousness—<em>computational phenomenology</em>—that is attentive to both the lived dynamics of the body and the distributed, emergent properties of adaptive systems. It challenges us to rethink cognition as a process of <em>enactive sense-making</em>, irreducible to either subjective introspection or disembodied computation.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The evolution of organology reflects an ongoing philosophical effort to understand the relationship between life, technology, and society. From Aristotle’s biological foundations to Stiegler’s analysis of technics and Hui’s cosmotechnical pluralism, the field has grown increasingly attentive to the complex co-evolution of organic and technical systems. Christophe Rigon’s scybernethic critique adds a vital layer, urging vigilance against the uncritical adoption of metaphors and models that risk conflating the organic with the technical. Together, these thinkers invite us to reflect not only on the tools and systems we create but also on the conceptual frameworks that shape our understanding of what it means to live, think, and act in a technological world.</p>

I’ll answer in three parts: (A) how the <em>PDP/connectionist</em> paradigm maps onto collective democratic intelligence, (B) concrete technical &amp; design interventions (what to build and how), and (C) governance, social &amp; anti-cooptation safeguards (how to keep those systems from being captured by neoliberal/fascistic pathways). I’ll keep it practical but theoretically grounded. I’ll cite a few recent projects and studies that show these ideas are feasible in the wild.

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">A — Why PDP (Parallel Distributed Processing) is a useful lens for democratic collective intelligence</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>PDP as a model of <em>distributed cognition</em></strong> — PDP emphasizes massively parallel, distributed representations where knowledge is an emergent property of many simple units interacting (weights, activations, patterns). That maps neatly onto how democratic intelligence should behave: not a single expert head, but a distributed substrate of many perspectives whose aggregated pattern produces robust, flexible judgments. (<a href=""https://web.stanford.edu/group/pdplab/pdphandbook/handbook.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">Stanford University</a>)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Representations and graceful degradation</strong> — PDP systems encode information in overlapping, distributed vectors; this produces robustness to missing or noisy inputs. Democratically engineered civic systems that use distributed representations can be resilient to manipulation, misinformation, and localized failures — provided the training and aggregation procedures are carefully designed.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Learning from many weak signals</strong> — PDP/connectionist methods excel at extracting structure from noisy, partial signals. In civic contexts, citizens’ micro-contributions (comments, votes, tags, local data) are weak signals; PDP-style ML can integrate those into useful public representations (summaries, clustering of concerns, emergent preference maps).</li>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">B — Concrete technical &amp; product interventions (what to build)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Below are implementable families of systems and the PDP/ML techniques that support them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">1) Civic embeddings + distributed deliberation layer</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What:</strong> Build an open “civic embedding space” — learned vector representations of propositions, arguments, policies, local needs, actors — trained on public-domain deliberations, legislative texts, civic petitions, local forums, plus citizen-labeled datasets.<br><strong>Why PDP matters:</strong> distributed representations let semantically similar concerns cluster without brittle ontologies.<br><strong>How to use:</strong> Use those embeddings to (a) surface clusters of shared concern across neighborhoods, (b) link citizens with complementary expertise, (c) detect emerging risks (hate amplification, misinformation), and (d) feed deliberative interfaces that recommend diverse, representative viewpoints rather than engagement-maximizing outrage.<br><strong>Safety:</strong> public, auditable embedding training data + model cards + versioning. (<a href=""https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/citizen-participation-and-machine-learning-better-democracy?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">turing.ac.uk</a>)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">2) Federated / participatory training pipelines</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What:</strong> Use federated learning and user-guided labeling so communities train or fine-tune the civic models themselves without surrendering raw private data. Citizens can contribute labeled examples (e.g., “this argument is ad hominem,” “this proposal affects rents”) and the model aggregates updates.<br><strong>Why PDP matters:</strong> PDP-style networks adapt continuously to distributed updates; the same mechanisms make federated civic models feasible.<br><strong>How:</strong> Combine federated gradient updates with differential privacy and transparent aggregation protocols. Build GUIs for distributed labeling that lower the barrier (micro-tasks, discussion-guided labeling). (<a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2502.18689v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">arXiv</a>)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">3) Deliberation-oriented objective functions (replace “engagement”)</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What:</strong> Replace or augment recommender objectives (maximize <em>quality of deliberation, epistemic diversity, fairness, robustness</em>) instead of pure engagement or ad revenue.<br><strong>How:</strong> Train/readjust recommender losses to include metrics such as viewpoint balance, deliberative turn-taking, factuality, and long-term civic benefit (measured by subsequent civic action quality). Use multi-objective PDP models to balance these.<br><strong>Prototype ideas:</strong> A hybrid recommender that maximizes a weighted sum: factuality score + diversity score + civic relevance – polarization risk. Regularly publish the weightings and allow citizen assemblies to propose adjustments.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">4) Scalable summarization + argument maps</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What:</strong> Use neural summarizers and argument-mining networks to convert long citizen deliberations into concise, structured “argument maps” with provenance and confidence scores.<br><strong>Why PDP matters:</strong> distributed encoders can compress many voices into joint representations; decoders produce human-readable summaries.<br><strong>Practical use:</strong> City councils, participatory budgets, and legislative consultations get machine-generated syntheses that humans edit — speeding deliberation and increasing inclusion.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">5) Simulation &amp; counterfactual agents for policy exploration</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What:</strong> Build lightweight agent-based simulators and learned surrogate models to test how policies play out (economic, social dynamics). Combine PDP models that learn from historical data with explicit rule-based agents.<br><strong>How:</strong> Citizens can run “what-if” scenarios and see predicted tradeoffs; deliberative forums use the simulations to ground debate in modeled outcomes rather than slogans.<br><strong>Benefit:</strong> Reduces hype and promotes evidence-based deliberation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">6) Auditability, model cards, and public datasets</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What:</strong> Every civic model must publish model cards, training data snapshots (or data schemas if sensitive), and independent audit interfaces (APIs that auditors can query). Open versioned checkpoints let communities test for bias and manipulation.

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">C — Governance, economic &amp; anti-capture safeguards</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Technical systems alone will be co-optable if the political economy stays the same. Below are necessary governance and social design principles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">1) Public ownership / non-profit platforms</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Platforms that host civic models should be governed as public utilities, cooperatives, or non-profits with democratic governance — not ad-driven corporations. This reorients objective functions away from attention maximization.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">2) Participatory algorithm design &amp; continuous civic control</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Create legally mandated participatory processes for algorithmic scopes used in public decision-making (e.g., city services). Use the “WeBuildAI” model: communities craft policy constraints and objective tradeoffs that practitioners optimize.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">3) Legal transparency &amp; audit regimes</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Push for “right to know” algorithmic governance and mandatory audits for platforms that shape public discourse. Courts, civic auditors, and NGOs should have access to the tools and datasets necessary to detect amplification of extremist or manipulative content. (<a href=""https://journals.law.harvard.edu/lpr/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2024/08/18.1-Right-to-Know-Social-Media-Algorithms.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">HLS Journals</a>)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">4) Economic incentives: de-monetize manipulation</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regulation should discourage business models that profit from divisiveness (ad auctions that reward virality), and incentivize long-term civic metrics (e.g., public grants for platforms that demonstrably improve deliberative outcomes).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">5) Resilience to adversarial manipulation</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Design models with adversarial testing pipelines: model-in-the-loop red teams, synthetic adversarial datasets, and continual evaluation for exploitation vectors used by malign state or corporate actors. Use distributed training and diverse data sources to reduce single-point vulnerabilities. (<a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02159?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">arXiv</a>)</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol class=""wp-block-list""><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Neighborhood Deliberation Embedding + Federated Summaries</strong><br>Pilot in a city: deploy a federated model that ingests local meeting transcripts and citizen micro-inputs, produces weekly multi-lingual summaries and argument maps for local councils; citizens vote on model objective weights in a rotating assembly.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Alternative Recommender A/B civic trials</strong><br>Run randomized trials where some users receive a deliberation-oriented recommender (diversity + factuality) and others the baseline engagement recommender; measure civic outcomes (quality of local meetings, informed voting rates). Make results public.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Participatory Algorithm Design Jam</strong><br>Convene a mixed group (citizens, ethicists, engineers, local officials) to co-design the loss function for a public service recommender; persist the agreed loss as a public contract the platform must implement.</li>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Use PDP-inspired distributed representations + federated and participatory training pipelines to produce open, auditable civic models whose objective functions are set and supervised by democratic assemblies (not ad markets). Implement deliberation-focused recommenders, summarizers and simulators, deploy them in publicly governed platforms, and protect them through legal transparency, audits, and economic incentives that punish divisive business models. Combined, these moves harness the strengths of connectionist ML (robust pattern integration, graceful generalization) while structurally steering outcomes away from attention-maximizing, polarizing capitalism.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For a long time, the dominant metaphor for the mind has been that of a computer—a complex information processor housed inside the skull, receiving inputs from the senses and producing behavioral outputs. This image of a ""brain in a vat"" has shaped not only science fiction but also much of our everyday thinking about who we are. We tend to see our minds as separate from our bodies, and our bodies as mere vehicles for a disembodied consciousness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This model, however, is being profoundly challenged. A growing wave of research from philosophy and cognitive science is painting a much richer and more dynamic picture. This new view sees the mind as fundamentally embodied, embedded in a world of action, and deeply interconnected with its environment. It suggests that thinking is not something that happens exclusively between our ears, but is an activity that extends through our entire being and even into the tools we use.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This post will explore four revelations from the frontiers of cognitive science, each of which dissolves a long-held boundary: between mind and body, between discrete emotions, between humanity and life, and between the self and its tools. Each one reveals a deeper, more integrated understanding of our own minds, moving beyond common sense to show how we are more than just brains in vats.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">1. Your memories aren't just in your head—they're in your hands.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of all our mental faculties, memory feels the most personal, the most ""in our head."" But what if its deepest records aren't stored in the brain's archives, but are written in the language of the body itself? This is the core insight behind ""body memory""—not the explicit recollection of past events, but the acquired dispositions, skills, and habits stored in the body's capacity for action. As philosopher Thomas Fuchs defines it, body memory is the totality of bodily capacities developed over a lifetime.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think of the muscle memory involved in riding a bicycle or the effortless way a pianist’s fingers find the right keys. These skills are not retrieved as a set of instructions; they are re-enacted through a body that has learned and remembers. This idea is surprisingly old, recognized even by thinkers like René Descartes, who is often associated with a sharp mind-body dualism. He observed:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thus, for example, lute players have part of their memory in their hands, because the facility to move and bend their fingers in various ways which they have acquired by habit, helps them to remember passages that require them to move their fingers in that way in order to play them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Modern experiments confirm this deep connection. A 2018 study by Camus et al. found that the specific type of physical action a person performs has a direct effect on memory performance, showing that memory is intertwined with the anticipated consequences of our movements. This supports the idea that the movements we make in the present moment actively shape how we recall the past.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This insight reframes memory not as something we passively access, but as something we actively <em>re-enact</em>. Our bodies don't just carry our brains around; they hold a deep, practical memory of our history of interactions with the world. This re-enactment is not just physical, but deeply affective; the way our bodies hold the past is inseparable from how they generate the shifting patterns of our emotional lives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">2. Your emotions aren't pre-installed programs—they're self-organizing weather patterns.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Are emotions fixed programs we all share, or are they something more personal, fluid, and complex? A new perspective suggests our feelings have more in common with weather than with software. Popular psychology often presents emotions as a small set of pre-installed, universal programs hard-wired into our brains—anger, fear, joy, sadness, and disgust. This ""basic emotions"" theory suggests these feelings are universal building blocks for our entire affective life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, this view is increasingly being questioned. Researcher Giovanna Colombetti points out that the common list of ""basic"" emotions is somewhat arbitrary and, contrary to popular belief, was never proposed by Darwin. The idea that our emotional lives are built from a few fixed, pre-packaged programs is proving to be too rigid to capture the sheer complexity and nuance of how we actually feel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An alternative perspective, drawing from dynamical systems theory, offers a more fluid and powerful metaphor. In this view, an emotional episode is not like a software program being run, but more like a weather pattern, such as a thunderstorm. A storm isn't a single ""thing""; it's a temporary, self-organizing pattern that recruits various processes—wind, temperature, pressure, moisture—into a highly integrated configuration. Similarly, an emotional episode recruits and integrates various processes (neural, muscular, autonomic) into a coherent, but transient, state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This perspective moves away from a rigid, ""one-size-fits-all"" model. It accounts for the vast complexity, context-dependency, and fluid nature of our emotional lives, seeing them not as a set of discrete programs but as ever-shifting patterns of mind, body, and world interacting together. This intimate dance between organism and world isn't limited to our emotions; it is the very basis of cognition itself, a ""sense-making"" activity shared by all of life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">3. Thinking isn't just for humans—all of life is engaged in ""sense-making.""</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the most radical ideas emerging from the enactive approach to cognitive science is that cognition—the process of knowing—is not limited to human-level problem-solving or abstract thought. The core tenet of this approach is that ""all living systems are cognitive systems.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this expanded context, cognition is defined as ""sense-making."" This is the activity of an organism bringing forth a world that is significant <em>for it</em>, based on its needs, concerns, and capacities for action. An organism doesn't passively receive information from a pre-given world; it actively creates a world of meaning, a ""Umwelt"" (phenomenal self-world) as described by Jacob von Uexküll in the 1900s. The classic example,  is the tick. The tick's world is almost entirely defined by just two things: the smell of butyric acid and warmth. These are not just neutral data points; for the tick, they signify the presence of a mammal—its source of food and its entire reason for being. The tick makes sense of the world in a way that is relevant to its survival.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The philosopher Evan Thompson, a key figure in the enactive movement, offers a clear definition of this broad conception of cognition:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Cognition” in this context ought to be understood broadly, to refer to “behavior or conduct in relation to meaning and norms that the system itself enacts or brings forth on the basis of its autonomy”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The implication of this idea is profound. It suggests that the roots of mind are not confined to the complex brains of vertebrates but are co-extensive with life itself. From the simplest bacterium to the most complex mammal, all life is engaged in a continuous process of creating meaning. But for humans, this ancient process of bringing forth a world is now deeply mediated by the powerful tools we've created—tools that are not passive objects, but active participants in our cognition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">4. Your phone isn't just a tool—it's a ""pharmakon"" that changes how you think.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The boundaries we draw aren't just between ourselves and the living world, but also between ourselves and the things we create. We tend to see our technologies, from hammers to smartphones, as neutral tools—passive objects that we pick up to accomplish a task and put down when we're finished, leaving us unchanged. But this view misses the deep and active role that technology plays in shaping our minds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The philosopher Bernard Stiegler offered a more powerful concept: technology is a <em>pharmakon</em>, a Greek word for a substance that is simultaneously a cure and a poison. A substance can be medicinal in one dose and toxic in another, and the same is true for technology. Our devices are not neutral; they are ""psychoactive"" and fundamentally alter our ways of being.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stiegler argued that technologies, especially digital ones, act as a form of ""tertiary retention""—an externalized, collective memory. Think of the internet, your photo library, or your saved contacts. This external memory doesn't just store information; it actively conditions our perception and shapes our future desires (""protension""). Following Martin Heidegger, the philosopher Yuk Hui notes that cybernetics is not just a technology but a ""completed metaphysics""—a new way of ordering and revealing the entire world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This means our phones, laptops, and apps are not passive instruments. They are active participants in our cognitive lives, shaping our attention, structuring our memory, and mediating our social interactions. Recognizing technology as a <em>pharmakon</em> requires a critical awareness of its dual nature. It calls for a conscious ""technopolitics""—a critical awareness and deliberate engagement with the tools that are, for better and for worse, actively remaking the landscape of our minds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Conclusion: Where Do You End?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The journey from a simple, brain-centric view of the mind to a more complex and integrated one is a radical shift in perspective. It asks us to see our minds not as isolated computers, but as processes that are fundamentally embodied in our actions, dynamically organized like weather patterns, enacted through a process of sense-making shared by all life, and deeply entangled with the technologies we create.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These four revelations don't just update an old model; they dismantle it. The primary casualty of this new scientific paradigm is our conventional sense of a singular, contained self. The neat boundaries we once drew between mind and body, self and world, nature and technology, all begin to blur. This invites us to reconsider the very nature of who we are. If our minds are woven from our actions, our environment, and the tools we use, where do ""we"" truly begin and end?<br></p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">1. Models and Simulations as Epistemological Tools</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the general context of scientific thinking, <strong>models, modeling, and technical metaphors play a crucial heuristic role</strong>. From the perspective of <em>scybernethics</em>, theories, paradigms, and models are viewed as <strong>""attentional grids""</strong>—ways of seeing and thinking that shape perception and interpretation of phenomena.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A primary focus is advocating for an <strong>epistemology of modeling and simulations</strong> of cognitive artifacts. This urgent necessity arises from the need to <strong>stop the growing confusion between models and empirical reality</strong>. The traditional scientific commitment implies that science does not describe the ""world-by-itself"" but, more subtly, our <strong>rational interaction, technologically mediated, with the world</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The purpose of modeling must shift from solely <strong>explaining (E-models)</strong> toward <strong>understanding (U-models)</strong>, which has historically been in the blind spot of traditional scientific modeling. U-models are comprehensive enough to integrate and include E-models.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">2. The Role of Experimental and Experiential Epistemology</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The use of computer models and simulations is articulated through the framework of <strong>""experimental epistemology""</strong> (as inspired by McCulloch) and <strong>""experiential epistemology""</strong>. This perspective emphasizes that the <strong>decisive thing with modeling is not the model per se, but what the model and working with the model does to our mind</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This approach is captured by the idea of moving <strong>""From computers which think to computers which make me think""</strong> (Cf. Bachimont).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. <strong>Experimental Epistemology (3P focus):</strong> Designing cognitive complex models and simulations allows the observer-actor to see the global bottom-up/emerging and behavioral consequences of local functional hypotheses, which might otherwise be impossible to deduce intellectually or mathematically.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. <strong>Experiential Epistemology (1P focus):</strong> Working with simulations, particularly those based on quasi-analogic paradigms like Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) connectionist models, leads to a trial/error converging experiential epistemology. By consciously using the illusory analogical power of these simulations, the observer-actor can <strong>reflect on their own thinking processes by feeling ""gestural""/sensori-motor schemes differentiations</strong>. This allows for the self-understanding and objectification of the mechanical dimension of one's own thinking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">3. The Epistemological Significance of PDP / Connectionist Models</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Scybernethics approach highlight <strong>Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) models</strong> (also known as Artificial Neural Networks or ""deep/machine learning"") as particularly valuable epistemological tools because they can be interpreted in a way that resonates with enaction and phenomenology.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead of viewing them merely through a statistical or associationist lens, PDP models are interpreted as dynamic systems that:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>• <strong>Simulate Analogical Bioprocessing:</strong> They simulate the scientifically repressed and intellectually unthinkable <strong>analogical bioprocessing</strong> of living cognition by processing in a parallel and distributed manner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>• <strong>Model Phenomenological Intentionality:</strong> They can be interpreted as <strong>models of enacted phenomenological intentionality</strong>, serving as an elegant computational model for the <strong>enacted emergence of natural categories as prototypes</strong> (Rosch).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>• <strong>Offer Post-Functionalism:</strong> They allow for a <strong>post-functionalist conception</strong> where cognitive functions and ""inferences"" are <strong>emergent and enacted</strong> by the network's learning activity, suggesting that our own logical reasoning is <em>a posteriori</em> of sensorimotor activities</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because the intricate dynamics of these systems cannot be fully understood intellectually or linearly, only the combined practice of design, observation, and epistemological culture allows for an <strong>intuitive and heuristic approach</strong> to access and make intelligible their ana-logical enactions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">4. Modeling within the Epistemological Approach (1P-3P Circulation)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This specific focus on modeling is integrated into the holistic <strong>Scybernethics</strong> (Second-Order Rationality²) approach, which relies on balancing dualities and integrating perspectives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Modeling becomes a key driver of the <strong>hermeneutic/co-determining circulation</strong> between the two main epistemological poles:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. <strong>First-Person (1P) Perspective:</strong> The <em>embodied</em> or phenomenological point of view, concerning the lived experience and self-understanding.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>

<p>2. <strong>Third-Person (3P) Perspective:</strong> The <em>abstract</em> objective science/Cartesian/Cognitivist perspective, concerning formal, intersubjective knowledge, including scientific culture and epistemology.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this framework, <strong>modeling becomes an active epistemological practice</strong> driven toward self-reflection. The iterative reflection on the model and the <strong>model of the modeling</strong> points recursively toward <strong>self-understanding</strong>. This is part of the <strong>""ambijective gesture,""</strong> a self-conscious cyclical process between objectification and phenomenological subjectification that co-determines the epistemological context and body-based meaning-making.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By embracing this 1P-3P methodology, the observer-actor explicitly includes themselves in the system being observed, aligning with the principle of second-order cybernetics. This realization fosters <strong>epistemological flexibility</strong>, enabling the individual to circulate effectively between complementary modeling styles and relate them to their own understanding.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">5. Critique of Reductionist and Confusing Modeling Styles</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The centrality of modeling epistemology also informs critiques of other popular approaches:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>• <strong>Critique of PP-FEP:</strong> Predictive Processing/Free Energy Principle (PP-FEP) modeling is viewed critically. While operationally effective for communication (""convincing""/selling), these statistical constructs are considered <strong>misleading and poorly ethical/rational</strong> if they are interpreted as solely descriptive of underlying biological processes. The normative mathematical description of FEP is often just an <em>a posteriori</em> rationalization of self-organizational processes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>• <strong>The Technology-by-Itself Fallacy:</strong> A crucial epistemological concern is the <strong>""technology-by-itself"" view subterfuge</strong>, where technology is mistakenly seen as neutral and self-operating. This leads to the illusion of interpreting complex cognitive simulations (like AI) as if they were independent entities, obscuring the human interaction and specific intentions embedded in the design and interpretation of the model.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""align"":""left""} -->
<p class=""has-text-align-left"">Ultimately, for the enactive paradigm to succeed scientifically, it must integrate these modeling practices in a reflective way, avoiding the pitfalls of reductionism and the confusion between simulation and reality, while continuously coupling disciplinary knowledge with the self-reflexive understanding of the observer-actor.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Introduction</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The application of new AI technologies, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine learning (ML), to strengthen democracy must be carefully scrutinized through the lens of Ezequiel Di Paolo's enactive philosophy and Barbara Stiegler's critique of expertocracy, as these thinkers challenge the foundational computational and elitist assumptions often underlying such technologies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Based on their conceptions, AI technologies should be utilized not primarily as tools for optimizing governance or aggregating opinions, but rather as <strong>instruments for enhancing participation, fostering critical consciousness, and providing ""intellectual arms""</strong> for genuinely autonomous public deliberation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The important key here is <em>to avoid at all costs the intellectual and cognitive proletarianization</em> (loss of know-how, cf. Bernard Stiegler) engendered by a passive use of these <strong>pharmakological tools</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">1. Utilizing AI through the Lens of Ezequiel Di Paolo's Enactive Philosophy</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ezequiel Di Paolo's work, particularly concerning <em>Linguistic Bodies</em> and <em>Participatory Sense-Making (PSM)</em>, emphasizes the embodied, historical, and non-representational nature of mind and language. His perspective fundamentally critiques the idea that the mind operates like a computer processing information, a metaphor that often drives AI and ML development. This metaphor can lead to a sense of alienation, where lived experience is reduced to ""neurons firing in the brain"" and the individual views themselves as a programmed machine, lacking true agency</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, any AI technology seeking to be compatible with an enactive view must prioritize interaction, participation, and ethical agency:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">1.1 Critique and Transformation of the Computational Model</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AI researchers and developers must engage in a <strong>critical investigation</strong> of LLMs and ML systems to reveal how they perpetuate the functionalist/computational metaphor, which conceives of cognition as the manipulation of internal representations. The goal should be to articulate positive, non-representational ideas about action and perception that move beyond mere information processing</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">1.2 Enhancing Participatory Sense-Making (PSM)</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Democracy relies on shared engagement and sense-making, which Di Paolo and his colleagues describe as constantly affecting participants' sense-making</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AI could be developed to support this process by:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◦ <strong>Facilitating Co-regulation:</strong> AI tools could map or analyze the <em>interactive dynamics</em> of large-scale digital deliberations, focusing on the quality of <strong>co-regulation</strong> and <strong>mutual interpretation</strong> between participants</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◦ <strong>Identifying and Resolving Breakdowns:</strong> Since genuine participation involves dealing with conflicts and breakdowns, AI could help identify where and how interactive breakdowns occur in digital discussions, offering pathways for ""reconnections"" rather than simply shutting down dialogue</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">1.3 Fostering Critical Linguistic Consciousness</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Di Paolo and his colleagues highlight the ethical dimension of linguistic bodies, which are perpetually in a state of ""becoming"" and must navigate the tensions of ""incorporation"" (of received utterances) and ""incarnation"" (of other agencies)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AI could be used to:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◦ <strong>Expose Ideological Manipulation:</strong> LLMs could be trained to identify patterns of <strong>""enunciatorless enunciations""</strong> (language lacking clear authorship, often characteristic of ideological narratives) or ""blanket references to collectives"" (""People think that..."") which enhance systemic asymmetries</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◦ <strong>Cultivating Resistance:</strong> AI tools could provide intellectual support for <strong>critical thinking</strong> by revealing hidden assumptions, prompting users to attune to ""feelings of discomfort"" when facing ambiguous orders or institutionalized language, thereby strengthening the ""powers of dialogic criticism, counterframing, interpellation, creativity, etc."". This aligns with the principles of critical pedagogy, which teaches that human beings are unfinished creatures capable of collectively becoming conscious of their potential and limitations.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">2. Utilizing AI through the Lens of Barbara Stiegler's Democratic Conception</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barbara Stiegler critiques prevailing conceptions of democracy—particularly the <strong>neoliberal version</strong>—which reduces it to competitive elections (minimalist/procedural view) and relies heavily on experts and ""leaders"" to govern the ""inadapted masses"". This view promotes the <strong>""manufacture of consent""</strong> rather than genuine self-governance (<em>auto-gouvernement du peuple</em>)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To strengthen democracy based on her ideas, AI must actively counter expertocracy and support collective, pluralistic deliberation:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">2.1 Empowering Autonomous Opinion Formation (Intellectual Arms)</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barbara Stiegler emphasizes that sociological knowledge and science should provide ""intellectual weapons"" (<em>armes intellectuelles</em>) to citizens so they can deliberate freely and make informed decisions, rather than being forced to delegate authority to experts</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◦ <strong>AI for Accessible Knowledge:</strong> LLMs could be crucial in democratizing access to complex scientific and intellectual productions by translating specialized research (like climate science or economic theory) into accessible forms, thereby enabling citizens to ""forg[e] their own opinions autonomously""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◦ <strong>Avoiding Prescriptive Answers:</strong> Crucially, AI must ensure that scientific information is presented as contributing to understanding the world (""what is possible/probable"") rather than dictating the specific political choice that ""it is necessary to make"". The final political choice must remain the object of deliberation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">2.2 Countering the Aggregation of Opinions (Doxa)</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Genuine democratic ""truths"" emerge from a <strong>collective elaboration</strong> involving a multiplicity of confronting perspectives. AI should therefore not be used merely to aggregate individual choices or predict political results (like the fictional supercomputer Multivac), which fails to produce collective knowledge</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◦ <strong>Supporting Multiplicity and Confrontation:</strong> ML systems should be designed to highlight the multiplicity of perspectives necessary for deliberation, avoiding the imposition of a ""unique interpretation of the social world</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":4} -->
<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"">2.3 Facilitating Collective Inquiry</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drawing heavily on John Dewey's pragmatist approach, the use of ML could help communities define their shared problems and evaluate solutions collectively, serving the ""inquiry"" process</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◦ <strong>Democratizing Problem Definition:</strong> AI must resist the tendency of elite groups (like political partisans or certain intellectual reviews) to elaborate the questions and possible responses <em>before</em> public debate. Instead, AI could help diverse publics articulate and define the problems that affect them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary, for AI to enhance democracy according to Ezequiel Di Paolo and Barbara Stiegler, its role must shift from being an <strong>information processor</strong> that aids elite governance (the functionalist/expert model) to a <strong>dialectical tool</strong> that supports radical, informed, and participatory self-governance (the enactive/critical model).</p>
